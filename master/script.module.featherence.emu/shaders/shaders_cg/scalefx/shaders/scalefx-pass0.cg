	ScaleFX - Pass 0
	by Sp00kyFox, 2017-03-01

Filter:	Nearest
Scale:	1x

ScaleFX is an edge interpolation algorithm specialized in pixel art. It was
originally intended as an improvement upon Scale3x but became a new filter in
its own right.
ScaleFX interpolates edges up to level 6 and makes smooth transitions between
different slopes. The filtered picture will only consist of colours present
in the original.

Pass 0 prepares metric data for the next pass.
