	ScaleFX-hybrid - Pass 0
	by Sp00kyFox, 2016-03-30

Filter:	Nearest
Scale:	0.333334x

ScaleFX-hybrid combines ScaleFX and a preshader (e.g. reverse AA).

ScaleFX is an edge interpolation algorithm specialized in pixel art. It was
originally intended as an improvement upon Scale3x but became a new filter in
its own right.
ScaleFX interpolates edges up to level 6 and makes smooth transitions between
different slopes. The filtered picture will only consist of colours present
in the original.

Pass 0 prepares metric data for the next pass.
