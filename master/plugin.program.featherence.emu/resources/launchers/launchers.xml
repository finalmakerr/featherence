					<gameplot>The player has been issued an emergency order. He must save the earth from being conquered by enemy forces. He climbs into his helicopter and prepares for intense aerial combat. Shooting oncoming enemy aircrafts and bombing the enemies below, he tries to make his way through the different stages to reach the enemy base. When he finishes the first stage, he is transported to his next mission by ab aircraft carrier. He hops into his jet fighters, tanks, ships, helicopters, and aircraft carriers. The player must also be aware of unseen enemies and surprise attacks. Different kinds of power ups can be obtained throughout the game. These include: '3' 3-Way: Bullets fire forward, right, and left. 'L' Laser: Player can shoot double lasers. 'T' Triple: Missiles are fired that spread out three ways in front. 'V' Vulcan: Rapid bullets are fired in the directions controlled. 'B' Bomb: Air to ground missles which can be upgraded twice. 'O' Orbital: A small drone using the same weaponry as the helicopter which can be otained by clearing a special formation of little red fighters. There is an additional super weapon that destroys all the enemies on the screen at once. However, use of this weapon is limited. Ajax contains 2 different types of stages : 2-D and 3-D. In the 2-D stage, the player controls a helicopter. In the 3-D stage, the player commands a jet fighter. Ajax features some impressive graphics filled with rotation and scaling effects (some may get a little dizzy, though!), a solid soundtrack and excellent game control. Highly recommended for any shoot'em up enthusiast!</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Congo Bongo is an isometric platform game and is Sega's take on Nintendo's legendary "Donkey Kong". The game begins with an animated cut-scene showing Bongo the gorilla as approaches the campsite of a sleeping safari hunter and sets fire to his tent. The player takes on the role of the hunter who has vowed revenge on Bongo for this cruel prank. The game consists of four different scenes. Each is timed by a bonus counter in the upper left corner of the screen. As time passes, the bonus decreases. If the bonus counter reaches zero, a player life is lost. Congo Bongo's four scenes are as follows:</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Dig Dug is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan video display. The screen shows a cutaway view of the land, most of which is below ground. The player controls the Dig Dug character who travels through and digs tunnels in the dirt. The object is for Dig Dug to destroy monsters by pumping them up or dropping rocks on them and to capture vegetables. Gameplay takes place on a cutaway section of the land. The characters are Dig Dug and two monsters - one is a round, orange monster with goggles called Pooka, the other is a green, fire-breathing dragon named Fygar. The underground area is divided into four different colored layers of dirt. Rocks are scattered in the dirt. The sky is at the top of the screen. The player controls Dig Dug, the hero of the garden, clad in white. He moves through horizontal and vertical tunnels. When Dig Dug digs new tunnels he moves slowly. When he is on the surface or in an existing tunnel, he moves faster. The object of the game is for Dig Dug to destroy all the monsters and go to the next round. Monsters are trapped in caves. A monster may get out of a cave two ways. Dig Dug may dig him out. Then, the monster chases Dig Dug. The monster may also get out of the cave by turning into a ghost. As a ghost, he cannot be destroyed. The ghost does not travel in the tunnels. He travels through the dirt, and can travel diagonally. However, he reappears as the monster when he goes into a tunnel. The monsters move faster than Dig Dug in vertical tunnels and slower on the surface. They destroy Dig Dug by catching him. In addition, Fygar can destroy Dig Dug by breathing fire on him. Fygar can only breathe fire horizontally. The fire can also penetrate thin layers of dirt. Dig Dug destroys the monsters by pumping them up until they burst, or by causing rocks to drop on them. To pump up and destroy a monster, the player presses and holds down the Pump button. It is possible to stun a monster for a few seconds by pressing the pump button once or twice. While a monster is stunned, Dig Dug may pass over him without being destroyed. If two monsters are very close together, only one may be stunned. The other will catch and destroy Dig Dug. Dig Dug must dig tunnels under the rocks to get them to drop. A rock may fall in a vertical or horizontal tunnel. A rock also goes through a thin layer of dirt from one tunnel to the next. In a vertical tunnel, Dig Dug may stay directly under a rock and it will not drop. However, in a horizontal tunnel, Dig Dug must move out from under a rock right away, or he will be crushed. After two rocks are dropped, a vegetable (worth extra points, see Scoring below) appears in a tunnel in the center of the screen. Dig Dug has ten seconds to capture (touch) the vegetable or it will disappear. There is only one vegetable per round. The game progresses by rounds. Round 1 starts with four monsters (one Fygar and three Pookas) and three rocks. The vegetable is a carrot. One flower on the surface (top right of the screen) represents Round 1. Two flowers represent Round 2, etc. As the rounds progress, the monsters move a little faster, and are better at avoiding falling rocks. In each round, the last monster tries to escape. If he is not caught by Dig Dug, he exits on the surface (top left). The game ends when all of Dig Dug's lives are used up. A player may continue to play at the beginning of the same round (level) by following instructions on the screen. He or she has 16 seconds to insert a coin(s). Then he or she must push and hold the Pump and Start buttons at the same time.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>For this sequel to the 1982 classic, "Dig Dug", Namco changed the game's perspective from a sideways viewpoint, to an overhead one. Action now takes place on a series of small islands. The gameplay itself retains much from its predecessor, with players still armed with a pump that allows them to inflate and burst the enemies. For this sequel, however, Namco also introduced ground-based charges. Players can activate the charges in order to join them up with other charges, represented on screen by the appearance of trenches. Once a line of charges is linked to two of the island's edges, the charges will detonate and destroy a piece of the island, killing any enemies that happen to be standing on the piece when it's destroyed. Players must be careful not to be standing on a piece that is destroyed, or they themselves will be killed.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A direct sequel to 1987's "After Burner", G-loc adopts its predecessor's action-packed, if somewhat limited, gameplay, although the game's pace has been noticeably reduced, making survival more a matter of skill than the shoot-and-hope gameplay of "After Burner". The bulk of G-Loc's action is viewed from a first-person, in-cockpit view, but, at certain points of the game, the viewpoint switches to the familiar third-person perspective of "After Burner", as the player's jet fighter is tailed by an enemy fighter. The player must roll and turn to shake off the pursuer, once this is achieved the game switches back to first-person perspective. The object of the game is to shoot a set number of enemy planes as they approach from front and behind; rolling and swerving to avoid incoming enemy fire. Certain stages feature ground-based enemy installations which must also be destroyed. The player's jet fighter is armed with both a machine gun, and a limited supply of missiles which can be 'locked-on' to enemy targets. G-Loc's levels take the player through a variety of different landscapes, including wide, rolling plains and rock-strewn canyons. Later in the game, the player must attempt to land their fighter onto an aircraft carrier. Failure to do so results in the game ending.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>In this, the first proper sequel to Namco's legendary pill eating maze game, players must once again run around a number of mazes, eating all of the pills that are scattered throughout. The ever-present ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Sue) return to hamper the player's progress. The infamous 'Power Pills' are also present and correct, with four appearing in each maze. Namco introduced a number of changes and enhancements over the original game. The first difference is in the main character. For the first time in video-game history, the game's lead character was female. Ms. Pac-Man is almost identical to the original character with two main differences; she wears a bow in her 'hair', and is also wearing lipstick. Another change from the original is that the bonus fruit items are no longer static but now move randomly around the mazes. Ms Pac-Man features four different maze layouts, which alternate every two to four rounds : The first maze is only encountered in Rounds 1 and 2, and has 220 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze equidistant from the center of the maze. You must clear this maze two times before moving on to the next maze. The second maze is only encountered in Rounds 3, 4, and 5, and has 240 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze; one set in the lower half, and the other set at the very top. You must clear this maze three times before moving on to the next maze. The third maze is first encountered in Round 6 and has 238 dots and 4 Power Pills. Unlike all other mazes, there is only one set of tunnels in this maze, slightly above the center of the board. You must clear this maze four times before moving on to the next maze. The fourth and final unique maze is first encountered in Round 10 and has 234 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze, directly next to one another in the middle of the maze. The turns at the entrance to the tunnels change the usual immediate accessibility of the tunnels and should be taken in to account. You must clear this maze four times before moving on to the next maze. After Round 13, the game alternates every four rounds between the third and fourth mazes. Finally, the ghosts' movement patterns are also completely different from those of the original game. As in the original game, intermission scenes will be played after certain rounds. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions tell the story of how Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man met, fell in love, and had a baby. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions are also preceded by a sign and a title. 3 intermissions are present : 1) Act I - They Meet : Pac-Man, the star of the original game, enters the screen being chased by Inky while Ms. Pac-Man enters from the other side being chased by Pinky. As the two of them are about to collide, they quickly move upwards, causing Inky and Pinky to collide. Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man face each other at the top of the screen, and a heart appears above them. This intermission is played after Round 2. 2) Act II - The Chase : Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are seen giving each other a playful chase. One chases the other in one direction, and they take turns alternating who chases who and in what direction. After three turns, they chase each other twice more at a faster speed. This intermission is played after Round 5. 3) Act III - Junior : Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man anxiously await the arrival of a stork, who flies overhead with a bundle. As the stork is about to pass over them, he releases the bundle, which drops to the ground in front of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, and opens up to reveal a baby Pac. This intermission, which is played after Rounds 9, 13, and 17, would later serve as the introductory sequence to "Jr. Pac-Man". No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.</gameplot>

Be careful, however : Pac-Man may eat a power pill and find that Blinky, who is right in front of the energizer for him to immediately eat, is still red, and now Pac-Man is dead. Also, you might want to try eating the ghosts after eating the center prize. They'll return to their normal forms shortly after turning visible.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Paperboy is a one or two-player game in which the objective is to deliver Newspapers to the Paperboy's customers from Monday through to Sunday. Each game begins with ten customers and ten non-customers. Paperboy's customers live in the brightly coloured houses, while non-customers live in dark coloured houses. To deliver to a customer, the player must throw a paper either into the customer's mailbox, or onto their front porch. Failure to deliver a paper to a customer results in the loss of that customer for the next day. Any damage done to a customer's property also results in the loss of that customer. Losing all ten of Paperboy's customers will get him fired and the game is over. However, on any day in which all customers have their papers successfully delivered, one of the non-customers will re-subscribe. Non-customers' houses and yards are loaded with targets at which to throw your extra papers (windows, lamps, statues, etc.). Hitting these targets earns points for the "Breakage Bonus", which is displayed at the top center of the screen. The total Breakage Bonus is awarded to the player at the end of each day (or at the end of the game-whichever comes first). If Paperboy loses a customer, that customer's house will be dark coloured the next day. As a non-subscriber, this house now presents more targets at which to throw newspapers for building up the Breakage Bonus. At the start of each day, a map of Paperboy's route is displayed to indicate subscriber and non-subscriber houses. This helps to remind players of what customers they may have lost on the previous day and the location of remaining customers. Paperboy can carry a maximum of ten papers at a time, but can restock his supply by riding over paper bundles placed here and there on his route. A paper supply indicator is displayed underneath the player's score. While making his deliveries, Paperboy must avoid collisions with all stationary objects and other characters moving about the neighborhood. To avoid collisions, Paperboy can ride his bike anywhere - on the sidewalk, in the street, or into front yards. A collision with anything results in the loss of a life. In addition to the obstacles, non-subscribers are hostile towards Paperboy and will attack him and try to knock him down. If Paperboy damages a subscriber's property, that character may also attack. So the more customers that are lost, the more hostile the neighborhood becomes toward Paperboy. At the end of each delivery day, players have a chance to sharpen their skills by guiding Paperboy through the Paperboy Training Grounds. This obstacle course is filled with various targets at which to throw newspaper, as well as ramp jumps to be negotiated. This is a bonus round and no lives are lost for failing to reach the finish line.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The object of the Q*bert game is to change the color of the top of the cubes to the Destination color indicated at the upper-left corner of the screen (below Player 1's score) by hopping onto them. When all the cubes in the pyramid have been changed to the Destination color, the screen will advance to the next round, with the player-controlled Q*bert character starting back on the top cube. At the beginning of each Level, there will be a short demonstration cycle with Q*bert hopping around four cubes to explain to the player the play action of each Level. Each level consists of four Rounds. The current level number and round number is displayed at the upper-right corner of the screen (below Player 2's score in a 2-player game). The game play starts with Q*bert appearing at the top of the pyramid. The joystick will move Q*bert from cube to cube by hopping in any of four diagonal directions. Q*bert can move anywhere on the pyramid, but jumping off will kill him. Hopping on the rotating disk will take Q*bert back to the top of the pyramid. In the first two Rounds of play, Q*bert will have to avoid touching the red and purple balls. These deadly objects drop randomly onto the second-from-the-top level and bounce downwards. The red balls will fall off the bottom, but the purple ball will stop at the bottom and hatch into Coily, the snake which chases Q*bert. To destroy Coily, lure him to the edge, then jump unto a disk. The disk will take Q*bert back to the top and Coily will fall off, awarding 500 points and clearing the board of all other 'nasty' characters. Starting at the 3rd Round of play, other 'nasty' characters come into play. The green characters or objects are safe to hop onto and will award points. All other 'nasty' characters are deadly to touch. In the third Round the red balls will stop falling, but two purple characters named Ugg and Wrong Way will appear at the lower portion of the pyramid and travel sideways and upwards (Ugg is the one with the snout moving from right to left on the right sides of the cubes, and Wrong Way is the one with the big eyes moving from left to right on the left sides of the cubes). They will not chase Q*bert, but will move randomly to get in Q*bert's way. In the third Round and every Round after, based on an internal timer, a green ball will appear and bounce down from the top of the pyramid. Hopping Q*bert onto the green ball will award 100 points, and freeze all the characters on the screen for a few seconds, but 'Q*bert' will still be able to move to complete the color changes. During the 4th Round of play, two green characters named Slick and Sam will appear, based on the internal timer (Slick is the one wearing shades; Sam does not wear shades, otherwise their function is identical). They will drop onto the second level from the top and hop randomly downwards. If they hop onto a cube that Q*bert has already changed the color of, the cube will change to a different color to thwart Q*Bert. Hopping Q*Bert onto Slick or Sam will stop them and award 300 points. Throughout the remaining Rounds, all the characters and objects will appear in random combinations with increasing speed. To add variety to the game, the disks will change positions every Round, and in the higher Levels the number of disks will change. During Level 2, the play action will increase in difficulty from changing the cubes to one color, to changing the color of the cubes twice. This mean: that each cube would have to be hopped on twice to change the pyramid to the destination color, completing the Round. Starting at Level 3 and for all remaining Rounds, and Levels, the play action will become more difficult. The object remains to change the cubes to the Destination color, but if Q*Bert hops on any cube, that cube will change color. So even if the cube has already been changed to the Destination color, it will change again. Here is a rundown of how all the colors change : Legend : S - Starting Color I - Intermediate Color D - Destination color LEVEL 1 : When Q*bert jumps on S or I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D (NOTE : During the 4th round, when Slick/Sam jumps on D, it changes to I). LEVEL 2 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D. LEVEL 3 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again. LEVEL 4 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to I. Q*bert must start again. LEVEL 5 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again. LEVELS 6-9 : Same color pattern as Level 5. The difference is the increased speed of Q*bert and the 'nasty' characters. There are also bonus points awarded at the end of each round for successfully completing the round. The bonus for the completion of the 1st round is 1000 points. This Bonus will progressively increase each Round by 250 points to a maximum of 5000 points at Level 5.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>R-Type is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the evil Bydo Empire rules the galaxy through fear and intimidation and it's up to the player - piloting their heavily-armed R-9 space ship - to battle through eight tough levels to the heart of the Bydo stronghold and defeat them. The game's revolutionary weapons system is its real stroke of genius. The first of numerous innovations that R-Type bought to the genre is the beam weapon: when the fire button is held down, a 'power meter' starts to charge up; once the meter is full, releasing the fire button unleashes a very powerful plasma burst capable of inflicting much greater damage to enemy ships or even destroying numerous enemies simultaneously. The trade-off is that charging the weapon takes up valuable seconds, giving the Bydo ships time to attack. The most significant addition to R-type's arsenal is the now-legendary 'Force Pod'. This takes the form of an invincible, detachable laser-firing pod that can be attached to either the front or rear of the player's ship, or can be detached completely, after which the pod sits some distance either ahead or behind the player's ship, tracking its movements and providing additional fire power. When attached to the R9 ship, the pod acts as a shield. This forms a crucial part of R-Type's gameplay and has to be fully utilised to navigate certain sections of the game, such as the huge mothership that comprises the game's 3rd stage. R-Type's levels are designed to make full use of its unique weapons system, making for very linear and demanding gameplay in which losing or picking up the wrong weapon at the wrong time often leads to an instant death. Its intelligent, precise and demanding level design, gave the world its first truly 'strategic' shoot-em-up.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The sequel to the hugely successful original finds the evil Bydo Empire once again intent on the destruction of all mankind in this sideways scrolling, six-level shoot-em-up. The innovative weapons system of the original game - the 'Beam Weapon' and 'Force Pod' - make a welcome return and remain unchanged for the sequel. The tight, demanding gameplay and high emphasis on correct usage of the weapons system also return - although the sequel is, if anything, even more demanding than its already unforgiving predecessor; with more durable enemies and trickier level design. R-Type II features three new weapon shot types:</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Space Harrier is a sprite-scaling 3D shoot-em-up set in the 'Fantasy Zone'; a surreal world composed of abstract structures and a checkerboard landscape. The game's enemies are as abstract as its setting; with creatures including prehistoric Mammoths, alien pods, giant mushrooms and, at the end of most stages, a huge, fireball-spitting Chinese Dragon. The player's on-screen counterpart carries a portable jetpack under his arm which allows him to fly. The player can also run along the ground to avoid overhead structures and enemies. In addition to its flight capability, the jetpack is also equipped with a laser, used to destroy both the game's many enemies as well as some (but not all) obstructions, such as the trees and floating rocks on the first stage. Space Harrier has a total of 18 stages, each with a boss fight at the end. Three exceptions are the bonus stages (5th and 12th) and the 18th stage, which is a 'boss rush' featuring some of the bosses encountered up to that point.</gameplot>

During his quest, Tiki can commandeer a variety of different weapons and vehicles - the latter of which include balloons and a hovercraft. The level design is superb, with exploration often rewarded with either bonus items, alternate routes to the end of the level, or secret level warps that transport the player to a later level (see 'TIPS AND TRICKS' for more details).</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Thrash Rally is a top-down perspective rally racing game for one or two players. Each race begins with players asked to choose a vehicle in which to race, with each offering a different balance between handling, acceleration, vehicle endurance and top speed. There are two racing modes on offer. The first, World Rally Championship, features rounds that take place over lap-based circuits, with each lap having to be completed within a set time limit. World Rally mode offers players a choice of six different rally cars. The second mode is the Paris-to-Dakar rally. This doesn’t feature laps but is a point-to-point race, with each stage having to be completed within a set time limit. In addition to the six rally cars of the World Rally mode, the Paris-to-Dakar Rally also allows players to race in either a buggy, a motorbike, or a truck. All tracks feature a variety of different road surfaces, such as snow, gravel, sand or water. Many of the tracks also feature a variety of jumps and chicanes, as well as track-based obstacles that should be avoided.</gameplot>

The game takes the player into and around Sherudo's clifftop, castle hideout. As the game's title suggests, time is one of the player's biggest enemies, as each area must be cleared within a strict time limit.

					<gameplot>להפעלת המשחק לחץ על המקשים Start+משולש![CR]"Turret Tower" is a one-player gunner/fighter pilot action game. The game components are housed in a compact 6. 5", octagon shaped cabinet. "Turret Tower" is a uniquely designed attraction. "Turret Tower" drops the player into an exciting war-bird environment. The player assumes the role of a gunner in a turret and also controls the direction of the aircraft. He sits in a swiveling gun turret and has the option of six wicked weapons to destroy his enemies. Two of the weapons, the mini-gun and grenade launcher are available at the onset of the game, plus the player gets to choose one of the four "super" weapons. Two of the "super" weapons are not available until the player reaches a specific level. The player chooses from one of three levels, each varying in difficulty. A "bonus" level is awarded to those players who successfully complete the first three. Each of the four levels are comprised of three waves of attack. The playing console, seat and monitor can rotate right or left a full 360 degrees! The player controls this motion using the joystick. A variety of power-ups are awarded to those players with the best homing and firing techniques. The power-ups are released by shooting parachutes during the game play. "Turret Tower" does not require an attendant due to the multiple safety features incorporated into the game design. These features include a door lock and seat belt, the deadbolt door lock must be in the locked position and the player must have the seat belt fastened in order for the game to operate. The floor mat will detect if there is more than one person inside the game or if the player is trying to stand up. If either of these conditions are detected the game will automatically stop operating.</gameplot>

The graphics are every bit as accomplished as those of the prequel and the game delivers a good level of challenge. The end-of-level bosses change from game-to-game; a nice touch that adds variety to an already solid game. Players can choose to play as any one of eight different fighter pilots, each of which pilots a different jet :</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The third game in this excellent series adheres to the solid shoot-em-up template set down by its predecessors. The player takes on the role of a Jet Fighter aircraft pilot whose mission is to combat world terrorism. The object of the game is to fly from country to country and destroy all opposition around the world, before flying into outer space to combat the menace responsible for the terrorism. Each pilot has his own storyline that ties in with the game. One enemy shot destroys the player's plane and releases a special power-up that the plane may have been carrying. If the player's final ship is destroyed, all power-ups and extra bombs are released and can be collected if the player chooses the 'continue' option, or if a second player is still active. However, on the final mission in Outer Space, the player is forced to start again at the beginning of the space mission, unless 2 players are active. Sonic Wings now features an array of 10 selectable pilots : American Vought F4U Corsair piloted by Robo-Keaton. American Northrop P-61 Black Widow piloted by the Blazers. Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero-Sen piloted by Hien. Japanese Aichi M6A1 Seiran piloted by Mao Mao. Soviet Il-2 Stormovik piloted by Chaika and Pooshka. Soviet Polikarpov I-16 piloted by Spanky. German Dornier Do-335 Pfeil piloted by Malcolm ('Pfeil' is german for 'Arrow') German Junkers Ju-87 Stuka piloted by Kowful and River. British Westland Whirlwind piloted by Alex and Pictus. British Fairy Swordfish piloted by Cindy and Ellen. There are also 2 secret planes (see the TIPS AND TRICKS section for details) : The Aka Usagi (Red Rabbit) piloted by Kotomi. The Diabloon piloted by The Man. Planes Spec. : Vought F4U Corsair can have 3 power-ups and 5 bombs. Northrop P-61 Black Widow can have 3 power-ups and 7 bombs. Mitsubishi A6M Zero-Sen have 3 power-ups and 5 bombs. Aichi M6A1 Seiran can have 2 power-ups and 5 bombs. Il-2 Stormovik can have 2 power-ups and 7 bombs.

					<gameplot>This game takes the player through several sections of the facility, including a warehouse and underground tunnels. The player is tasked, along with fellow STAAR members, to penetrate Area 51 and activate the nuclear self-destruct sequence. The player must kill all of the genetically altered soldiers and aliens without harming any allied STAAR team members (at the cost of one life point), however if nothing but three STAAR team members are shot, the Kronn Hunter will be started, taking the role of a Hunter, sent by the Kronn to eliminate the rebels. None of the actual aliens will appear until the office level. There are five types of different weaponry available to the player during the course of the game. While the player is only given a semi-automatic pistol in the beginning, weapon upgrades are available as targets throughout the game. The pistol can be upgraded to an automatic machine gun, a pump shotgun, and finally an automatic shotgun. The shotgun weaponry allows a greater field of error for targeting an enemy in able to kill it. Both the machine gun and automatic shotgun allow the player to keep the trigger pressed down to unleash rounds. If the player is hit by the enemy at any time, the weapon is downgraded back to the pistol. The player will also find grenades in crates and bonus rooms which, when used, destroys most on screen enemies at once. The player can hold a max of 9 grenades. In addition, yellow boxes and barrels marked with flammable warning symbols can be shot to cause fires or explosions that can harm enemies. The game is notable for its use of digitized video stored on an on-board hard disk, and the bizarrely-contrasting, unrealistic gibs into which every enemy blows apart when shot, in exactly the same way. While enemies, innocents, and explosions are 2-D digitized video sprites, the levels and vehicles are pre-rendered in 3-D.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Asterix is a 1- or 2-player horizontal-scrolling beat'em up based on the French comic series, 'Asterix &amp; Obelix'. The player fights as either Asterix the Gaul or his best friend, Obelix, as they take on the 'might' of the oppressive Roman Empire. Asterix includes a variety of humorous fighting moves, which are demonstrated in the game's attract mode. The artwork and feel of Asterix remains true to its French source material, and the game's many humorous touches (such as the way defeated Legionnaires crawl away) will be instantly familiar to fans of the comic-book and cartoon series. Bonus levels - such as the chariot race that awaits at the end of the first level - introduce different game-play elements to provide a break from the fighting.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Blasteroids is a 1 or 2-player update of Atari's seminal "Asteroids", where the object of the game is to clear all sectors of the asteroids and enemy ships. Once this task is completed, the player goes on to battle Mukor - the "boss" asteroid who rules all galaxies - and destroy him. The player's ship appears first in the center of four vortices, he or she must chose which vortex they wish to enter, which then transports them to a sector of their chosen star system. Unlike in "Asteroids", the player ship has a finite amount of fuel which must be replenished as often as possible. This is achieved by destroying specifically-colored asteroids which turn into collectible crystals. Not all sectors contain the crystal-bearing asteroids, however, and if the player runs out of fuel, a ship is lost. The game contains three different ship configurations and the player can switch between them at any time during a level. The three configurations are : Speeder (small and fast, but weak), Fighter (medium speed and strength) and Warrior (large and strong but very slow). Additional power-ups can be collected to improve the player's chances, some of the items available are : additional guns, larger fuel tanks, crystal magnets and impervious shields. Some of these add-ons are time-limited while others last until the player's current ship is destroyed. In the asteroid field, there are also 'popcorn' asteroids; small blue rock formations that grow larger and travel faster with each hit they take until they become large, non-moving objects on the screen. These obstacles must be avoided since hitting them will drain all of the ship's fuel, costing the player a life. A popcorn asteroid can not be destroyed. Hitting anything other than bonus power-ups and energy crystals costs precious fuel. Clearing a sector of all of its asteroids takes the player back to a screen and shows a preview of all of the cleared and uncleared sectors in this star system. Some sectors are marked as "unknown" and no preview is offered for these levels. From here, the player can choose which system they wish to tackle next. All systems need to be cleared before the player is given the chance to battle against Mukor himself. To kill Mukor, the player must eliminate each of the volcanoes with multiple blaster hits. Destroying a volcano causes Mukor to release bonus power-up items, and destroying all of the volcanoes causes Mukor to flee, returning the player to the selection vortices. Later, after all other sectors have been cleared, the player will eventually have to face Mukor again and this time, the enemy boss will have to be destroyed. After Mukor has been destroyed, the game ends. In the simultaneous two-player game, the first person to fly their ship into a vortex chooses the star system to which the players go. A unique feature of two-person play is the docking of ships : to dock, one player must transform their ship to the largest size while the other transforms to the smallest. By touching the two ships together, they dock and form one large ship. The player originally with the larger ship now controls the speed and direction of the docked ship and can fire straight forward. The player with the smaller ship controls a turret that can rotate and fire independently of the main ship. The dock is broken when the player with the small ship hits their 'thrust' button.</gameplot>

Players can switch between the two modes at any time, but only carry a limited amount of grenades or rockets. Weapon power-ups and additional grenades and rockets can be picked up throughout the levels. At the end of certain levels, the game's heroes will enter an elevator and players can then choose whether to go 'up' or 'down', depending on which route through the game they wish to take. Each level has a large end-of-level boss that must be defeated.</gameplot>

The player assumes the role of a pilot who is sent by their squadron to fight their former allies until one side destroys the other, all of which is a part of a mission to strengthen the military power that controls each side. The player flies their selected fighter over 5 areas of various terrain, encountering a number of land, sea and air enemies. The player's ship has two modes of fire : by tapping the fire button, shots are fired; holding it down produces a concentrated vertical beam, but also reduces the ship's speed. The player can choose one of 3 aircraft at the start of the game, or upon continuing : Type A : A red (or yellow/orange, for player two) fighter, which fires a narrow stream of shots Type B : A green (or purple, for player two) helicopter, which fires its main guns forward, but has side guns that rotate in the direction of movement Type C : A blue (or black, for player two) fighter, which fires a wide, three-way spread of shots</gameplot>

The Black Warriors is made up of six distinct enemy characters- plus Willy, the game's final boss - with each differing in both physical appearance and fighting style.

					<gameplot>Following his defeat at the end of the original Double Dragon, Willy, the leader of the Black Warriors, retaliates against Billy and Jimmy Lee by murdering their friend, Marian, leaving the brothers with the task to avenge her death. The sequel to Double Dragon is essentially an upgraded version of the original game, but with with a two-way attacking system similar to one previously used in Technos Japan's 1986 arcade game "Renegade". Many of the attacks and combos from the original "Double Dragon" are retained, as well as new techniques including the invincible Cyclone Kick. The stages and weapons are redesigned versions of items previously featured in the original game. There are a few new traps such as a bulldozer in the middle of Mission 3 and all of the transition sequences between stages are now done with the character entering the next level via a lift, making it impossible to carry one weapon to the next area. Most of the enemy characters return from the original Double Dragon, with some given facelifts, but the stage bosses are all new. The enemies are as followed :</gameplot>

At this moment, their great ships are arriving at major cities around the globe preparing to conquer and claim what is rightfully theirs... the human race.

					<gameplot>A one-on-one fighting game featuring nine selectable characters and three end bosses, controlled with a single joystick and six buttons. In addition to the usual kicks and punches, each character also has a number of special moves, that can be utilized via complex joystick and button combinations. In the one player game, players can chose their first opponent, with subsequent opponents chosen randomly by the game. Unusually for a game of this type, Kaiser Knuckle features blood; something that had hitherto only been associated with Midway's "Mortal Kombat" series. The blood option can be switched off in the game's dip settings. Kaiser Knuckle was Taito's answer to Capcom's Street Fighter II during the fighting game trend of the 90s. Despite showing highly detailed and unique content in the arcades, it didn't catch enough attention to become a success and was never ported to home consoles. A unique feature is that this was the first and only fighting game to feature five different strength for basic punches and kicks. Another unique feature are power zones, these are activated when landing a special move when a character's Power (Crush in the Japanese version) meter is full. Power zones contain electricity or fire that can help improve a character's special move. Stage backgrounds can also be destroyed by the combat, getting hit fills the Power meter and when a special move connects when it is full, it greatly damages the background walls and can unlock the fire or electric zones found in levels.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The quest to defeat the mysterious Baron of Battlers, the mysterious "K", is on. In order to get to this grotesque gladiator, you need to fight your way through 13 with the most skilled, most deadly of all combatants in the world of physical contact. Use your powers of pulverization, psychic energy blasts, and ridiculous strength to become the explosive fighting god in FIGHTER'S HISTORY DYNAMITE!!! Don't just participate in history, MAKE IT! The sequel of the first "Fighter's History", this time ported in the Neo Geo MVS Hardware. In this new version of the original game several changes and improvements were made to enhance the gameplay: now the battles are faster and more technical, with the usual friendly combo system that makes the fight so spectacular. There are also some powerful hidden moves added for most of the characters. Even the graphic was slightly enhanced, with a nice color palette and some wonderful backgrounds (especially Zazie's). The game actually suffered from the reputation to be a 'SFII clone' given by the general opinion from the first episode. Thanks to this new chapter of the saga, which was particularly appreciated by the Neo Geo fans because it is one of the rare 'SFII style' beat'em ups on the Neo Geo this changed. A really nice and classical beat'em up, still worthy to be played, especially for the real fans of the 2-D beat'em up.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>10 genetically engineered fighters engage in 1-on-1 combat in a tournament arranged by the sinister 'Ultratech', the organization behind the genetic creation of the fighters. The tournament soon turns into a battle for survival. Each player starts the game with 2 energy bars, which represent the amount of health each player has for the entire game. Once the first bar is depleted, the player falls, gets up and starts to use the second energy bar. A voice will subsequently announce either 'Round Two' or 'Killer Instinct!'. The player who wins the first round gets to keep their remaining energy, and still has the second bar to use in future fights. This gives an advantage to the player who wins the first round. Killer Instinct introduced incredibly complex combos to the fighting genre, as well as including the Fatalities and Humiliations made famous by Midway's "Mortal Kombat" Series.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A great sequel of the previous game include new features and new characters. The plot follows on where the first installment left off. Eyedol's death at the hands of Orchid accidentally sets off a time warp, transporting some of the combatants back in time and allowing the Demon Lord Gargos to escape from Limbo. Now, trapped 2000 years in the past, the warriors that survived Killer Instinct, along with several new faces, fight for the right to face Gargos in combat. Each character that survived the journey from the first game has a corresponding background story, while new characters on this installment are native inhabitants of this past time period. Some fighters, like T.J. Combo who survives from the original, just want to get home. Others, like new character Tusk, want to bring an end to Gargos and his reign of evil. This time there is no tournament or prize money, just a fight to the finish with the fate of the future hanging in the balance.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A scrolling 'run-and-gun' platform game for one or two players, Metal Slug is a humorous parody of war and specifically of World War II and the Nazis. The game features six enemy-packed levels, referred to as 'missions'. Players start the game armed only with a pistol, but extra weapons can be picked up and used for greater firepower. Also, at certain points during a level players will find an unused 'Super Vehicle-001' - or Metal Slug - tank which can be entered and driven. The Metal Slug is slow-moving but has very powerful weapons. If the Slug takes too many hits it will break down and start to flash, the player must then quickly exit the vehicle before it explodes. The enemy troops also have vehicles at their disposal, such as tanks, boats and helicopters. The levels are littered with bearded hostages who, when rescued, award players with either points bonuses (in the form of medals) or weapon power-ups. Available weapons are Heavy Machine Gun, Flame Shot, Rocket Launcher and Shotgun. Hand grenades are also available. Each level ends with at least one large enemy 'Boss' vehicle that takes many hits to destroy. Once the boss has been destroyed, bonus points are awarded for each prisoner rescued. Further bonus points are awarded if the player's Metal Slug vehicle has survived the boss battle.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The heroes of Metal Slug, Marco and Tarma, are called into action once again to take on the might of General Morden and his armies in this, the first of several sequels to the superb 1996 original. This time, however, Morden has acquired a number of powerful allies to aid him in his evil schemes, some of which are not even human. The 2 brave soldiers are called upon to deal with this threat once again, aided by members of the newly founded 'Sparrow Squad', Fio and Eri. Metal Slug 2 improved on much of what made the first game great; featuring more enemies, larger bosses, more weapons, more vehicles, more hostages, more surprises and more humour than its illustrious predecessor. The occasional moments of slowdown that blighted the first game are still present, however.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The heroes of the first 2 games return once more to do battle with the ever-present General Morden and his vast army. The third game of the series places a greater emphasis on defeating hulking boss characters than the 2 previous outings. Metal Slug 3 also introduced multiple routes through most levels, vastly increasing the replay value of the game. For example; on the first level the player reaches a point where they can either continue over land, or enter a small submarine and head down into the ocean depths, where they will be faced with a variety of huge, deadly sea-dwelling creatures. Metal Slug 3 introduced a number of new elements that have a direct effect on the player's character - similar to the 'mummification' of the second game. The first of these is the 'fatty' affect : should the player pick up too much food (fish, for example) their character will morph in an obese version of itself. This doesn't have any detrimental effect on performance and is included purely for reasons of humour. Another effect is the now infamous 'Zombiefication'; should the player's character be attacked by a Zombie, he or she will become Zombie until they are either killed, or pick up a first-aid, which will restore the player's character back to human form. Movement while in the zombie state is slow and restricted but the player is armed with what can perhaps be best described as the 'Zombie Vomit'; a huge arc of blood that can be used to destroy oncoming enemies. A second Zombie attack while the player's character is in a Zombie state will result in the player losing a life.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Mortal Kombat 2 is a direct sequel to the 1992 original featuring new fighters (increasing the character roster from 7 to 12) and improved graphics. As with its predecessor, MKII's matches are divided into rounds, with victory awarded to the first player to win two rounds. At the point of defeat, the losing fighter will become dazed and the winner is given the opportunity to execute a 'finishing move'. Some of the standard fighting moves (moves shared by all characters) have now been expanded or enhanced. A crouching punch has been added and the 'roundhouse kick' is more powerful and now knocks opponents across the screen. Also, the difference in hit boxes between high and low kicks is now more marked. Additionally, returning characters gain new special moves and MKII marks the first appearence of multiple Fatalities - as well as additional, non-lethal finishing moves - in the series. In addition to the Fatalities of its predecessor, MKII offers 'Babalities' (turning a defeated opponent into a crying baby), 'Friendships' (a non-malicious interaction, such as dancing or giving a gift to the defeated opponent) and stage-specific Fatalities (the winner uppercutting their opponent into an abyss below, spikes above, or a pool of acid in the background). Each character still shares generic attributes - speed, power, jump height and airtime - albeit with differing hit boxes. The sequel drops the points system of its prequel in favour of a consecutive win tally.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>One or two players take control of 2 machine-gun carrying Vietnam vets who must shoot their way through a number of sideways scrolling, Vietnam-themed levels. the players shoot into the screen and aiming is achieved via the use an on-screen target, which each player directs to lock on to the various enemy troops and vehicles. Players can run and somersault to avoid the incoming enemy fire. A number of more powerful weapons - such as grenades and flame throwers - are often dropped by the enemy and can be picked up and used. Bonus points are also revealed in this fashion. Nam-1975 is a blatant plagiarism of TAD Corp's "Cabal", released in September 1988. Cabal is easily the more accomplished of the two games.</gameplot>

Each level is populated with enemy scientists and agents, and any contact with these will result in the loss of a life. To help combat this, players are armed with a 'stun gun' which will knock the enemy to the floor, allowing the player to pass. If an enemy is held in the stun gun's beam for several seconds, the enemy will fall to the platform below. At the completion of each level, part of a cartoon picture of woman in a state of undress is shown. The entire picture is revealed once every four levels.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A 1 or 2-player sideways scrolling beat-em-up sees the Sailor Senshi fighting their way through five levels of anime-based combat. Each Sailor Soldier - chosen from a selection of 5, stiletto and mini skirt-wearing combatants - can punch, kick, jump, and throw their enemies; before finally reaching the traditional end-of-level boss. As with Capcom's "Final Fight", and indeed many other games of the genre, items that aid the player are either dropped by beaten enemies or revealed after hitting certain obstacles and containers. Food can be used to replenish lost health and various trinkets can be picked up for bonus points. Finally, magic crystals can be found and are needed to activate the 'special attack' move. This works in a similar way to Sega's "Shinobi", with every enemy on the screen taking a hit. Players must have at least one crystal to use the Special attack and up to 5 crystals can be carried at once. The more crystals the player holds when the special attack is utilized, the more effective it is against the game's enemies. Each level features its own unique, anime style animation. On level five, Sailor Soldier's signature attack move, from the original Japanese anime upon which the game is based, makes an appearance.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>PuLiRuLa is a six-level, sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 or 2 players that defies any logic in either its theme or its graphical approach; that places the players in a dream-like world populated by armies of strange and bizarre creatures. PuLiRuLa's plot centres around the world of 'Radishland'. Each of Radishland's six towns is kept running smoothly with the aid of a giant key, which is necessary to keep the world's 'time-flow' moving. The key is stolen by a mysterious enemy and the timeflow is disrupted. Players must fight their way through waves of increasingly abstract enemies in their quest to recover the key and restore time to Radishland. To aid players in their quest, they are each armed with a magical stick, with which they can hit and defeat the game's abstract enemies. Players are also armed with a limited number of smart bombs, capable of killing multiple enemies. The smart bombs are as visually unique as the rest of the game; taking the form of such things as a herd of running animals, a purple dancing blob-like man or a man in a giant microwave oven who captures and cooks any on-screen enemies. When killed, the enemies disappear and an animal or townsperson is released from inside the creature.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The third and final arcade release of this classic series (which would foster three further console-only sequels, see 'Series' for details) sees the Bydo Empire waging a full scale assault against other planets. R*Type Leo possesses many of the elements that made the first two games in the series such classics, but the feel and gameplay is very different. Both the beam laser and the pod make a return, but play a different role in this game. The pod in particular now acts more like a mini 'smart bomb', in that it only detaches from the player's ship for a few seconds, and automatically homes in on enemies. The level design is also far more open than that of its predecessors, and far more forgiving. R*Type Leo is a game that firmly divides opinions of fans of the series. Some considered it to be a blasphemy to the R*Type name, arguing that in making a game far more 'traditional', both in feel and level design, R-type Leo actually represented a step backwards from what the innovative original achieved. Less patient players undoubtedly prefer Leo's open levels and forgiving gameplay. Something that all can agree on, however, is how stunningly beautiful the game is. The detail and use of colour on both the backgrounds and enemy ships is incredible and is one of the finest examples of two-dimensional artwork the arcade has ever seen.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A 3-D vertically scrolling shooter featuring  a lock-on secondary weapon. The third installment and prequel of RayForce, the plot centers detailing the events during the timeframe of the supercomputer called the Neuro-Computer Con-Human gaining sentience and rebelling against its human creators, a direct result of a misguided scientist trying to bond a human clone to Con-Human mentally. Now, against Con-Human's massive attack forces laying siege to the Earth, exterminating and cloning humans, a mecha-neurologist jacks in to the Con-Human system in an attempt to regain control of the rogue machine by means of the computer viruses, known as the Waveriders, into the Cybernetics Link, engaging Operation Raycrisis to cease the supercomputer's destructive actions permanently and prevent it from causing more havoc in the future. However, even when Operation Raycrisis leaves Con-Human wrecked from the inside, it was too late to reverse the damage it has done. Furthermore, what is left of the human race has left for the space colonies as refuge from the destruction. In the end, years later, with the unveiling of the X-LAY starfighter and the ships of the fleet, Terran Command and the remaining humans initiate one final assault on Con-Human, who has turned the Earth into a bleak, metal graveyard. One final assault, in which will end the cybernetic nightmare once and for all, destroying the planet they've called home in the process. And that assault will be called: Operation RayForce.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A one-on-one fighting game - the collaboration between Capcom and SNK - pits seventeen well-known SNK combatants against seventeen of Capcom's most famous game characters. 'SVC Chaos' primarily utilizes the command system of the "King of Fighters" series, incorporating light/strong kicks, punches, cancels and charging attacks. Unlike its predecessor, however, "Capcom vs. SNK 2", SvC features no air guards and lacks a 'groove system', instead focusing on quicker game play and online competition. Each character is equipped with a basic three-bar system for executing 'Exceeds' (special attacks), with basic filling options attributed to strikes and damage. Additionally, the sprites from the various series received new models and some special effects were changed in the command lists (For example, the player can no longer increase the damage of the 'Zujou Sashi' used by Choi Bounge by tapping the buttons).</gameplot>

While the game doesn't break any new ground gameplay-wise, and is little more than a retread of (and tribute to) the original game, what it does it does very well; and the graphics in particular are nothing short of stunning.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Shock Troopers pits the players against a mighty terrorist group who are holding a girl hostage, in order to force her grandfather to surrender a powerful drug which will enable the terrorists to control the minds of the grandfather's soldiers and create a huge, unstoppable army. Shock Troopers is a multi-directional scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players that builds upon the foundations laid by Capcom's 1985 classic, "Commando (Capcom)" and also borrows heavily from Commando's sequel, '"Mercs". As well as enemy troops, players must contend with tanks, choppers and assorted military vehicles, and must also be careful to avoid any of the landmines that litter the levels. Extra weapons and health can be picked up from destroyed enemy vehicles, as well as being found in enemy supply crates. Shock Troopers is effectively three games in one as players can chose one of three different routes; each made up of different levels. The game also offers greater variety of gameplay than other of the genre; with levels having the players travel on the back of fast moving vehicles, climbing a rock face etc.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>More of an update than a full-blown sequel, Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad picks up where the first game - released a year earlier - left off. Once again, one or two players face the might of a terrorist army who are threatening to destroy the world by launching a newly developed weapon-of-mass-destruction if their wishes - to be given absolute control of the newly-founded nation of Billberk - aren't granted. Like many Neo Geo sequels, 2nd Squad doesn't particularly do anything the original didn't do. There are some improvements, however; graphics have been given a brush up and level design is a little more imaginative than that of the already impressive original.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 to 4 players; choosing from Spider-Man, Black-Cat, Hawkeye or Sub-Mariner. The heroes must fight their way through four levels of Dr. Doom's villains; including Venom, The Scorpion, The Lizard, The Green Goblin, The Sandman, The Kingpin, The Hobgoblin, Electro, Dr. Octopus and, of course, Dr. Doom himself. Each player character has a different weapon or power that can be used throughout the game while fighting. Spider-Man uses his webs, The Black Cat uses her 'cat's claw' grappling hook and cable, Hawkeye uses his bow and arrows and The Sub-Mariner uses his hydro-electric charges. The game's viewpoint pans in and out between alternate large and small scale (4-way scrolling) sections. The game's 'camera' zooms out on alternate levels with the zoomed-out view introducing four-way scrolling platform sections to the gameplay. The game ends when the fourth and final chapter has been completed.</gameplot>

The gameplay in Tekken 2 is identical to that of its predecessor, with one or two players fighting over a series of 3D-rendered backdrops. As before, the fighting system utilises four attack buttons: left punch, right punch, left kick and right kick. Certain button combinations will initiate both standard and special grab and throwing moves.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Toobin' is a unique fantasy-adventure game. 1 or 2 players can race Bif and Jet, the Toobin' dudes, in their inner tubes, down 45 different rivers. The players try to keep Jet and Bif afloat, avoiding sharp objects, gaining points, and throwing cans at obstacles. Toobin' appeals to both males and females of all ages who both find it just 'fun to play'. Toobin' has a continuous buy-in feature so players can join in at any time. Toobin' has a color-coded control panel and players can identify Jet in the yellow inner tube and Bif in the black inner tube and red shorts. Each player has a set of four buttons to steer Bif or Jet forwards, backwards, and sideways. Pressing the two Paddle Forward buttons moves the inner tube forward. Pressing the two Back Paddle buttons moves the inner tube backwards. Pressing only one Paddle button makes the inner tube turn. The player uses the Throw Can button to destroy obstacles in the river and stun riverside pests. Toobin' players can enjoy amusing game play and an incredible variety of rivers and environments for their long-term enjoyment. The player races Bif or Jet against other players, or against the game, down Toobin's 45 different rivers, paddling through six classes of play, and cruising the 15 unique river environments. The player can choose almost 200 courses through the rivers, finding his own way through rapids, obstacles, riverside pests and waterfalls. The player has to guide Bif or Jet around obstacles, go through gates and pick up treasure to accumulate points to get more inner tube patches, collect cans to throw at obstacles and to stun riverside pests, and paddle fast enough to avoid the big 'gator lurking in all the rivers. At the finish line, players are treated to a party. Each party grows in size until the player reaches the final super party at the end of the game. Inner-Tube Patches : At the beginning of each game, the player has a certain number of inner-tube patches, which represent game lives. A player receives extra patches by scoring the number of points required for another patch. The number of points required changes from level to level, and is displayed in the lower left and right corners of the playfield. A player can also receive more patches by picking up patches floating in the rivers. Cans : The player must accumulate cans to throw at obstacles and pests. All cans are the same value. The player can pick up individual cans floating in all the rivers or six-packs hidden under obstacles or in back waters (Six packs give unlimited cans). The player throws the cans by pointing Bif or Jet at the obstacle and pressing the Throw Can button. Most of the obstacles in the river can be eliminated by hitting them with a can. Dangers : The player must avoid or eliminate dangers in the river and stun pests on the river banks. The dangers in the river include falling rocks, floating logs, deadly falling coconuts, icebergs, mines, stampeding cattle, snakes, crocodiles, barbed wire, and thorny bushes. Dangerous riverside pests throw and shoot objects at Bif and Jet. The player can stun most of these objectionable characters with a can thrown in their direction. These pests include Casting fishermen, Hillbillies, Terrorists, Devils, Martians, Street punks, Pistolaros, Natives, Penguins, Bears, Dinosaurs, and Cavemen. Big 'Gator : If a player is slow, the big 'gator comes up from behind to discourage slow play and hurry the player through the gates. A loud thumping sound warns the player of its presence. One escape from the big 'gator is to quickly paddle downstream or pass through a gate. If the gator catches Bif or Jet, one inner-tube patch is lost.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Twin Eagle II is a vertical scrolling shooter where one or two players pilot heavily armed helicopters through three stages with three areas each. At the start of each stage, the players select their path of attack through the three areas.  Areas with ground level enemies and targets are presented in a 3/4 isometric view, while areas with no ground targets feature scrolling landscape images.  Players use their guns to attack flying enemy aircraft and bombs to attack ground targets such as tanks, rocket launchers and high-rise skyscrapers.  If things get too hairy, the player can use a missile barrage to clear the screen of enemies and enemy firepower.  Destroying some buildings reveal primary colored trucks which drop weapon power-ups and point items when destroyed.  Each area features a boss at the end, which must be destroyed to advance past the area.  The final stage features one additional boss before the end of the game.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>In this 3-D fighting game, the game's battle system is simple, yet complex. There are 3 buttons : Punch, Kick and Guard. Movement is strictly confined to a horizontal plane. Battles are won by draining the energy bar of your opponent or by pushing your opponent off the edges of the ring (known as a 'Ring-out'). When a 'Draw' is declared (timer reaches zero with both fighters having an equal amount of energy), a Sudden Death match is held on a very small platform, making a win by Ring-out that much more probable. The game favours tactical play over mindless button bashing, and the gameplay is balanced accordingly to reflect this.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Warrior Blade is a fantasy-themed hack-and-slash game for one or two players, featuring both horizontal and vertically scrolling levels. Unlike previous Rastan games that featured only Rastan himself, players can now choose to play as one of three different warriors: Rastan, Dewey (a hireling) or Sophia (a thief). Players must then fight their way through a multitude of enemy-packed levels set in a variety of different locations, such as castles, a forest, a swamp and on board a sinking ship. Certain levels also have the players riding on animals, such as horses and dragons. Coins and treasure items can be found in the numerous barrels and chests that litter the levels, as well as being dropped by some defeated enemies. Bonus points and "vitality" - depending on the amount of treasure collected - are awarded upon the level's completion. As well as coins and treasure, other bonus items can be found that give weapon and magical-weapon power-ups, as well as extra vitality (health). Level progression through the game is not linear. After the very first level, "Depon Road", players are presented with a map of the Kingdom, and can choose which of four different routes they wish to take next. The available routes are; Castle (Northwest), Tower (Northeast), Ship (Southwest) and Palace (Southeast).</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Wild Fang is a sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 or 2 players with a medieval setting. Players take on a variety of orcs, ogres, demons and other mythical creatures in their bid to destroy Satan, decapitating each enemy they encounter in order to collect their skulls for points and power-ups. The player's character is an armor wearing beastmaster who sits atop of a fist-fighting giant.  Upon the player's command, the player may switch his mount into a tiger and attack with his mace.  Within each stage, there are also power-ups that allow the player to morph into a laser breathing dragon for a limited period of time. The player's life bar is represented by a fire breathing dragon in the upper corner.  With each hit the player takes, the fire breath grows smaller.  Once the life bar is depleted the player's mount is killed and the player travels on foot and fights with throwing daggers.  If hit in this form then the player loses a life.  The game is over when all of a players lives are lost.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A mysterious fortune teller warns Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee about the rise of a powerful enemy in Egypt. Since the Lee brothers are looking for a true challenge to put their martial arts skills to the ultimate test, they agree to face this mysterious new enemy. They embark on a world quest - joining up with new allies in the process - and try to lay claim to the famous 'Rosetta Stone'. The 3rd and final arcade entry of the Double Dragon series (not counting the later Neo-Geo fighting game based on the movie) features a completely gameplay system and graphics from the first two installments. The game can played by up to 2 or 3 players, depending on the cabinet and settings. The 3rd player takes control of a yellow-clad Lee brother named Sonny, who is exclusive to this game. Techniques from the previous games such as the hair grab and the elbow punch are gone, but new ones are added such as the belly-to-back throw and the back-to-back hurricane kick, as well as the ability to dash by tapping the joystick left or right twice. The game features weapon shops that allows the player to purchase power-ups by inserting additional tokens. The power-ups differ between stages differ between stages and are available as followed.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Up to four players race each other over a variety of different surfaces on a selection of narrow, twisting roads, in this scrolling top-down racing game from Sega. Each player's vehicle has a fuel (gas) meter that constantly depletes as the race progresses. Extra fuel (and bonus pick-ups) are placed at regular intervals on each track and can be collected by driving over them. If a car runs out of fuel it is automatically disqualified from the race. During races the track scrolls to follow the current race leader. If the last-placed driver falls too far behind the leader and allows the scrolling area to catch up with them, their car is automatically transported further up the track, resulting in a fuel penalty. There are always four cars competing in each race (with computer-controlled cars replacing any positions not filled by human players). Any driver finishing in the Top three is awarded bonus points, with the amount determined on whether they have finished 1st, 2nd or 3rd. These points can be used to buy a variety of car upgrades in the garage shop that appears at the end of every race. The upgrades available are; engine, tyre, wing and bumper. These affect speed, handling and durability. Particular attention should be paid to tyre choice, as different tyres are suited to specific race surfaces.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Based on the movie of the same name, Moonwalker is a scrolling, isometric beat' em up in which Michael Jackson (1958-2009), along with his chimp Bubbles, attempts to save children and defeat the evil 'Mr. Big'. During each round, the player must defeat each and every one of Mr. Big's henchmen and the deadly enemy machines that patrol the levels. This is achieved either by shooting them with Michael Jackson's 'magical energy', or by using his Dance Magic - the game's equivalent of a smart bomb. Some enemies take only one shot to defeat whereas others take several shots before they are destroyed. The longer the player holds down on the fire button, the greater the amount of magical energy Michael can inflict. At the start of each round, the player is given 2 dance magic smart bombs. Towards the end of each round, Michael's pet chimpanzee, Bubbles, will be seen moving about. If Michael touches Bubbles, he will turn into a powerful robot (the 'Moonwalker' of the game's title). After Michael has become Moonwalker, he will be able to shoot lasers and fire missiles. Michael must defeat every boss enemy at the end of each round in order to proceed to the next. Each player's Michael Jackson character looks identical but wears a different colour : white (left player), red (middle player), and black (right player).</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A sequel to the 1986 original, Rampage World Tour once again has George, Lizzie, and Ralph bent on a trail of destruction. The 'World Tour' of the title refers to the fact that the action now takes place around the entire world, instead of just North America. Graphics are much improved and a kick button has been added to allow even more chaos. Hidden bonus items have also been added to the game; two examples are an item that allows any player character to transport to almost any location in the game instantly. A second gives the players more destructive power. Some stages have a vat of toxic chemicals that can mutate any player character into a huge purple bat-like creature called V.E.R.N (Violently Enraged Radioactive Nemesis) for the duration of the stage.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A scrolling, isometric racing game for one to three players featuring Sega's legendary mascot, 'Sonic the Hedgehog'. Sonic's nemesis, 'Dr. Robotnik', is once again intent on World domination and is preparing to launch his latest attack from his new island base, Eggman Island. When 'Sonic', 'Ray', and 'Mighty' drop in to thwart his plans, Robotnik catches them with one of his devious machines. After finding themselves imprisoned in a tower, the trio break free onto the island, and proceed to make their escape and try to defeat Robotnik and his evil plans. Sega Sonic's gameplay retains elements of the original console games, such as Sonic's ability to jump on the heads of enemies to kill them. The golden rings that Sonic collects are also included. Each level is littered with Dr Robotnik's devious traps; with lava flows, collapsible platforms, locked gates etc. all serving to hamper Sonic's progress.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Arabian Magic is a scrolling beat-em-up for one to four players, set in the mythical world of The Arabian Nights. A long time ago, an evil wizard has taken over the peaceful kingdom of Shahariyard and used sorcery to transform its king into a Monkey. The player must defeat each of the game's seven Guardians to reclaim the 'Jewel of Seven Colours' and release the king from the evil hex. Each player can select from four distinctive characters: Prince Lassid, Princess Lisa, Sinbad or Afshael. Each character carries a primary weapon - Prince Lassid and Sinbad carry swords, Princess Lisa a magical veil and Afshael a mace. In addition to the weapons, players can also summon a magical attack in the form of a huge genie. The genie will only appear for a few seconds but during that time, players have control over the genie and can steer him towards enemies. Arabian Magic has seven different stages with one of the powerful guardians awaiting the player at the end of each level. Each guardian, once defeated, will drop a jewel which forms a part of the Jewel of Seven Colours. Guardians, once defeated, will join the player and become a Genie. Each level is littered with vases and wooden chests which, when broken, reveal treasure items and power-ups. The game ends when the player has recovered the Jewel of Seven Colours, saved the King (making him human in the process) and restored peace to Shahariyard.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Gauntlet is a maze-based shoot-em-up for up to four players. Heavily influenced by classic fantasy conventions, players take on the role of either Thor the Warrior, Thyra the Valkyrie, Merlin the Wizard, or Questor the Elf and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes. Competitive play is encouraged as players must fight for the limited amount of food, treasure, magic potions and power-up items that litter the dungeons. Each of Gauntlet's four characters have different strengths and weaknesses: Thyra has the strongest armour, Thor is best at hand-to-hand combat, Questor has the fastest speed and Merlin has the most powerful magic attacks. The object of the game is simply to survive as long as possible while exploring Gauntlet's mazes in search of treasure, food, magic potions and, ultimately, the exit that leads to the next dungeon. The potions - shown as blue bottles - that litter the levels offer either improved character abilities (such as 'speed' or 'extra shot power') or can be used as a 'smart bomb', destroying some or all of the on-screen monsters. Potions are also the only way to kill the game's 'Death' character that appears in many of the stages. Magic potions can be kept and used at the player's discretion by pressing 'Magic' button, although each potion can only be used once. The first seven mazes are always the same, but from level 8 onwards, players will find themselves on any one of over a hundred different mazes. If players survive for long enough, the mazes will be repeated in a different order. How long a player lasts depends upon the player's 'health' level. Health continually depletes as time progresses and further health is lost by contact with various monsters or their projectiles. Health can be replenished by consuming the food found in the mazes or by inserting more credits. The many treasure chests that litter the levels can be plundered for points, and collecting treasure increases a player's score multiplier when two or more players are playing the game.</gameplot>

					<publisher>Atari Games</publisher>
					<gameplot>Gauntlet II is a direct sequel to the legendary maze-based fantasy themed shoot-em-up, released a year earlier. Atari chose not to tinker with the core game-play mechanic to any great degree, opting instead to enhance the already excellent multi-player action that had created such a stir upon the original game's release. As with its prequel, up to four players once again take on the role of either 'Thor the Warrior', 'Thyra the Valkyrie', 'Merlin the Wizard', or 'Questor the Elf' and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes, collecting potions, food and treasure as they searched for the exit that would lead them to the next dungeon. Changes to the sequel included the ability for players to play whatever character they wanted, even if that character was already in play. Characters were now colour-coded and players would find themselves taking on the role of 'Blue Elf', 'Green Wizard', etc. New in-game speech was added to allow for the new player definitions. Other changes included the ability to 'bounce' shots off walls - known as 'Reflective Shots' - providing the correct potion was picked up. As well as new potions, Gauntlet II also featured several new monsters. The most notorious of the new additions was the Fire-breathing Dragon that guards the exit to some dungeons. This powerful creature takes multiple hits to kill and defeating it would see the players rewarded with a permanent potion and a bag of treasure. Another notable addition was the 'It' monster: any player who was tagged by the creature would suddenly find that all of that level's monsters would ONLY chase the tagged player, completely ignoring the presence of all other players. The only way to remove this curse was to tag another player, thus making them 'it'. New level elements were also added to further increase variety. These included dungeons with entirely invisible walls, magical walls (which changed into monsters or items when hit), stun tiles (which stunned any player that walked on them) and exits that flashed between functioning and non-functioning.</gameplot>

Built on the strength of "Gauntlet Legends", Dark Legacy takes the action to a new dimension with new characters, new realms, new combos and improved graphics. Four new characters join forces with the original four Legends characters to explore and battle their way through eight realms of gameplay. The Mountain, Desert, Forest and Castle Realms have been updated to match the depth and complexity of the four new realms... Ice, Town, Sky and Dream. There is also a bonus Battlefield Realm. Multi-player gameplay has been enhanced by allowing two players to work together to activate special moves with new combos. In addition, Dark Legacy is full of secret codes and passwords that give special access to alternate characters and many other surprises (see 'Tips And Tricks' section for more information).</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Gauntlet Legends is a fantasy themed action game, a sequel to 1985's popular "Gauntlet" and 1986's "Gauntlet II". Its unusual features for an arcade game included passwords and characters that could be saved, enabling players to play over the course of a long period of time. It was a role-playing game, though with very limited role-playing. The simplicity of the original Gauntlet series is still here : You have to find your way out of a maze using keys, secret passages, and switches. In your way are hordes and hordes of enemies, endlessly reproducing themselves from generators painfully spread around the gigantic, menacing levels.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Like it's legendary prequel, 1989's "Golden Axe"; 'Revenge' is sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which the evil 'Death Adder' has arisen to take over the lands. The game supports simultaneous four-player gameplay, with each player taking on one of the game's characters. The four available characters are 'Sternblade' (a barbarian warrior), 'Dora' (a female centaurian), 'Goah' (a giant with a dwarf sitting atop his shoulders) and 'Little Trix' (an agile, oriental-style warrior). As with 'Golden Axe', as well as standard weapon attacks, each character has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will cause the player to charge and smash into opponents. At certain points during the game, players will come across certain creatures and contraptions (such as dragons, giant scorpions and catapults) which, once the original occupier has been removed from the saddle, can be mounted and ridden/utilized to attack the enemy. At certain points during a level, as well as at the end of each level, dwarfs appears carrying a sack on their back. Players can hit the dwarfs causing them to drop food and magic potions. During the course of the game, players will also come across numerous trapped prisoners. These can be released by either opening their cages (by pulling a rope or similar) or hacking at their foot manacles. Unlike the linear level layout of its prequel, 'Revenge' offers the player a branching route through the game, adding to its variety and longevity.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A horizontally scrolling fighting game for 1 to 4 players. Each playable character (chosen from Mark, Glen, Akira and Gil) kicks and punches their way through a number of enemy-packed levels. In addition to kicking and punching, each character also has their own unique 'special attack'; a move that injures multiple on-screen enemies at the cost of some of the player's health. While in no way original (drawing most of its inspiration from Capcom's "Final Fight"), Karate Blazers is both hugely playable and very fast and frenetic, with the amount of on-screen enemies at times overwhelming. The graphics are also well drawn and nicely animated.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A colourful and playable ten-pin bowling game for 1 to 4 players, offering a choice of three scoring methods : 'Regulation', 'Flash' and 'Strike 90'. The game begins with players selecting either a right or left-handed bowler, before choosing what weight they want their bowling balls to be. Once the match starts properly, Power and Direction meters will appear and players must use both their judgement and timing to select and execute the desired bowl. Timing is key as players are only allowed twenty seconds to make each shot. The 'Strike 90' mode awards players ninety points for a strike and sixty points for a spare. In the 'Flash' game mode, the points flash across the lane as the players throw the ball. Should they succeed in knocking down the standing pins, the points that are displayed at the time the pins are struck will be added to the players' scores.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Sunset Riders is a superb sideways scrolling shoot-em-up for one to four players set in America's Wild West. Four sharpshooter bounty hunters (Steve, Billy, Bob and Cormano) set out to claim the bounties given for killing the most wanted outlaws in the West. The ultimate aim is to survive long enough to reach the final showdown against Sir Richard de la Rose. Sunset Riders is an incredibly playable game featuring colourful and well-drawn graphics, with a number of humorous visual jokes keeping players entertained. The side-scrolling action takes place both on foot and on horseback, with the action sometimes broken up with a wild west pursuit; such as having to run along the backs of a herd of fleeing Buffalo. Each level ends with players entering a one-on-one battle against one of the wanted men they have been pursuing. Weapon power-ups can be found and collected to help players in their quest.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A sideways scrolling beat-em-up in which up to four players can choose to play as either 'Leonardo' (blue, katana blades), 'Raphael' (red, sais), 'Michaelangelo' (orange, nunchakas) or 'Donatello' (purple, bo staff) as the infamous turtles fight against the might of Shredder's army to try and rescue 'April O'Neil' and 'Splinter', before a final confrontation with their arch-enemies 'Krang' and 'The Shredder'. Ninja Turtles featured just two buttons - for 'Jump' and 'Attack' - making for simple and immediate gameplay. Visually the game made great use of its license and perfectly captured the spirit of both the original comic-book and cartoon series upon which it was based. The game also featured a 'buy-in' option, meaning that new players could join in at any time.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The sequel to 1989's hugely successful original, 'Turtles in Time' once more sees the four heroes taking on Shredder and his army. Gameplay remains similar to the original game, but the experience is enhanced further with the obligatory improved graphics and sound effects. 'Turtles in Time' also features a larger variety of levels, as now the battle between good and evil rages across time as the Turtles travel to prehistoric, pirate and Wild West times in their pursuit of the elusive Splinter. Yet again, Konami's mastery of the genre was in evidence as the manic energy and humour of the cartoon and comic-book series upon which the game is based was captured perfectly.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A jewel heist gone wrong sees Mr Burns's sidekick, Smithers, kidnapping Maggie and making his escape. Between one and four players take on the role of either Homer, Marge, Lisa, or Bart in this colorful, horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up from Konami. Each Simpsons character possesses an attacking move specific to them; Marge is armed with a vacuum cleaner, Lisa has a skipping rope, Bart has his skateboard, and Homer fights with his fists. The players must battle their way through a variety of Simpsons-themed levels - such as Springfield and Krustyland - fighting goons, thugs, zombies, drunks, firemen, and several Simpsons regulars. Many Simpsons characters that don't appear as enemies have 'cameo' scenes in the game (Otto working at a burgerstand in Krustyland, for example). The archetypal 'boss' character awaits the players at the end of every stage. The game ends with a final showdown with the evil Mr. Burns in his luxurious mansion. The Simpsons was designed to Konami's typically-high production standards and was, like the 'Ninja Turtles' games that appeared a couple of years' earlier, very faithful to its source material. The colorful, smoothly-animated sprites captured the spirit of the legendary cartoon superbly, and the game's many humorous touches were timed to perfection.</gameplot>

The X-Men's mission is to find and rescue Professor X, who has been captured by evil mutants and is now being held prisoner by Magneto. Each X-Man character has an 'Attack', 'Jump' and 'Mutant Power' button. The mutant power attack is a powerful special move unique to each X-Man. While it inflicts a lot of damage on the enemies, the trade-off is that each usage removes 3 bars from the players health meter (a full meter has 10 bars). Each level ends with a face-off against a powerful mutant boss character. The game has six stages, with the final one set on 'Asteroid M', Magneto's base. The defeated mutant bosses from the previous levels each make an appearance (albeit in a less powerful form) before the final encounter with Magneto himself. Players can chose from 6 X-Men characters, they are: Cyclops Colossus Wolverine Storm Nightcrawler Dazzler</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Designed by the legendary Eugene Jarvis (creator of, among other things, "Robotron" and "Defender"), Cruis'n USA is a point-to-point racing game featuring fourteen separate courses set in a number of different US locations. Each race takes place against nine other rival cars. In addition to the player's opponents, the roads are packed with civilian traffic that must be avoided. Any collision with either other vehicles or with trackside objects will result in lost time as the player races against both the clock and the nine rival racers. On many tracks, collisions can be avoided by driving off-road, although this has as inverse effect on both handling and speed. The in-game physics are skewed entirely toward arcade-style handling. The aforementioned collisions have vehicles bouncing and spinning as though made of rubber, before righting themselves back on the track.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A single player takes on the role on an undercover cop and gets behind the wheel of a custom Porsche in this Miami Vice-inspired racer from Taito. The player has 60 seconds to catch up to the criminal and then a further 60 seconds to ram his car until it is too damaged to drive. Like Sega's seminal "Out Run", Chase H.Q. features forked junctions offering players a choice of routes; in this game, however, the route selected is merely a temporary diversion and dictates how quickly the criminal is caught up with. The player's Porsche is equipped with a limited number of turbo boosts which, when used, push the car to incredible speeds - at the expense of control. The turbos must be used wisely if the player is to have a chance of capturing the criminal before the time limit expires. Chase H.Q. was arguably the first sprite-scaled racer since Sega's legendary "Out Run" - released 2 years' earlier - to truly capture the gaming public's imagination. The game consists of 5 levels.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Out Run is a ground-breaking racing game in which the player drives a red Ferrari Testarossa through a number of colourful European locations, trying to reach each end-of-level checkpoint before the tight time limit expires. Each of the game's stages is packed with civilian traffic that must be carefully avoided, as players try to negotiate the game's twisting, hilly roads. At the end of every stage players are presented with a fork in the road, allowing them to chose which route they wish to take next. This was not the first time this feature had appeared (Tatsumi's 1983 racer, TX-1, was the first to introduce forked roads). As well as being able to choose routes, players could also - via the game's "in-car radio" - choose one of three different catchy tunes to listen to while driving. The songs are 'Magical Sound Shower', 'Passing Breeze' and 'Splash Wave'.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>In Power Drift, a single player races against eleven other drivers over any one of five abstract and hugely demanding courses. The game's 25 stages (separated into five different races, only ONE of which can be played per game) are constructed of undulating, tilting, roller coaster-esque tracks; featuring jumps, drops and chicanes. On most of the stages, it's possible to 'fall off' the higher sections of the track, crashing to the ground below and losing valuable seconds. Power Drift's superb Roller Coaster effect was enhanced further with the introduction of a 'tilting axis'; as the player steers left and right, the screen display mirrors the controller's movements and tilts on its axis, in a similar fashion to another Sega game, "After Burner". Power Drift was yet another visually superb 3-D "sprite-scaling" racing game from Sega and, having already perfected the racing genre with 1986's "Out Run" and the "Hang-on" series; the company charged Yu Suzuki and his team to take the arcade racer in a wholly new direction.</gameplot>

Racing Hero is the spiritual successor both to Sega's wonderful "Hang-On" series, and to their most famous racing game, "Out Run". Some of Racing Hero's stages mirrored the racing-through-traffic gameplay of the Ferrari-based racer, for example perhaps the biggest similarity to Out Run is that at the end of each stage, the player can choose which route he or she wishes to take next. This differs somewhat from "Out Run"'s highly impressive forked-road method. In Racing Hero, the player is presented with a seperate stage-select screen and simply highlights the flag of whichever country they wish to tackle next.</gameplot>

Hidden shortcuts help you gain valuable seconds. You must choose from four pizza couriers each with his or her own particular abilities. There are three game levels: Margherita (easy), Capricciosa (medium) &amp; Diavolo (difficult).

					<gameplot>A direct sequel to 1988's "Chase H.Q.", S.C.I. once again puts the player in charge of an unmarked police car - this time a Nissan 300ZX T-Top Turbo - in which the player must chase and capture a criminal mastermind before the time limit expires. Graphically, S.C.I. is very similar to its predecessor, although there are slight improvements with both a better use of colour and the introduction of some new weather effects; such as the rain on the first stage. Unlike the first game, the player is armed with a gun; this is used to take out criminals and roadblocks as the player races against the time limit, and also to capture the criminal mastermind and make an arrest before the time limit expires.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A racing game in which up to eight players (via linked cabinets) compete in a lap-based race around one of three testing courses. After each lap, the slowest car is eliminated and the game continues until only the winner remains. In the single-player game, the player competes against a field of A.I. controlled cars. Each player selects one car from the ten that are available, then chooses their preferred track (Beginner, Advanced or Expert). The action is fast and furious and the game can vary between one and nine laps, depending upon the number of rival players. An on-screen map in the upper right-hand corner of the display indicates the positions of all rival racers.</gameplot>

The width of Le Mans' racetrack never varied and remained a constant 3 lanes wide. The track itself was incredibly demanding and contact with either a rival racer or one of the many track-side objects would send the player's vehicle flying dramatically through the air, costing valuable seconds in time.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The 3rd chapter in Taito's legendary 1 or 2-player bat and ball game, in which players once again control a paddle and must try to rebound a ball into patterns of bricks to remove them from the play area. Each level is patrolled by enemies and certain bricks, when hit, release power-ups which then roll down the screen and can be collected by the player. While the 3rd chapter contains 50 brand new levels for players to fight through, the actual gameplay itself remains unaltered from the first 2 games. The only real differences are a revamp of both the graphics and sound, as well as a number of minor enhancements to the in-game power-ups.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>One or two players take on the role of Bub and Bob, two cute dinosaurs who must battle through 100 platform-packed single screen levels to rescue their girlfriends. Bub and Bob are armed only with the ability to blow bubbles, in which the game's many enemies can be trapped and killed. The bubbles can also be used as temporary platforms, to help the dinosaurs reach previously inaccessible areas of a level. Any trapped enemies who are not killed quickly enough will turn red and escape their bubble prison. These angry enemies are much faster than before, making them harder to kill. Enemies also become angry if players are taking too long to complete a level. Defeated enemies are turned into bonus fruit items that can be collected for points. On many levels, bubbles containing fire, water or a lightning bolt appear. These can be burst by players to release their contents and destroy enemies. The fire bubble drops flames down onto the nearest platform, killing any enemies it hits. The lightning bubble sends a lightning bolt horizontally across the screen, its direction dictated by whichever side of the bubble the player hits to burst it. The water bubble releases a torrent of water that will quickly flow down the platforms to the bottom of the screen. Any enemies caught in the flow are killed. Bubbles containing letters also appear. The aim is to collect the letters needed to speel the word E.X.T.E.N.D. which earns players an extra life. The game's simple-yet-involving game-play saw Bubble Bobble become an instant classic. Its two-player co-operative mode, coupled with the incredible amount of hidden secrets and potential for strategic play - unheard of in the platform genre - would set the standard by which all other platform games were judged.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Bubble Bobble 2, also known as Bubble Symphony, is the first direct sequel to Taito's 1986 platform classic, "Bubble Bobble" ('Rainbow Islands' was the first official sequel, but played very differently) in which one or two players take on the role of the infamous bubble-blowing dinosaurs who must once again fight their way through a large number of single-screen platform-based levels, trapping monsters with their bubbles before bursting them to destroy the trapped enemies. While the game plays identically to its predecessor, several new changes and additions have been made to breathe new life into the classic gameplay. As well as new bonuses, weapons, enemies and characters, players can now create 'Multiple Bubbles'; if the player holds the button down for a few seconds before releasing, up to three bubbles are produced at once. Other gameplay changes include Boss encounters that occur every five to ten levels. These boss screens are part of a new 'branching level' structure; once a boss is defeated, players chose to enter one of two doors to determine what level set they tackle next. In addition to the Bubble Bobble's original heroes, Bub and Bob, two new selectable female characters have been added, called Kululun and Cororon. Each of the four dinosaurs possess different gameplay attributes, which are as follows :</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The third and final arcade outing for Bub and Bob (not counting the 'Puzzle Bobble' series), Bubble Memories returns once more to the classic, single-screen gameplay of the series' legendary first outing. Graphically, the game is very similar to 'Bobble Bobble II', released a year earlier; the only real visual difference between the two is the latter game's use of some rather charmless digitized animal photographs that form the game's backdrops. One new gameplay addition, however, is the introduction of 'Super Bubbles'; There are now two sizes of bubble. Hold down the bubble button for about 1 second until you glow to produce a giant bubble. This giant bubble can trap either a single large enemy, or several smaller enemies. This replaces the 'Multiple Bubble' facility of the previous game in the series; 'Bubble Bobble II'.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>One or two players control safari-suited characters armed with harpoon guns, who must destroy the numerous different-sized balloons that litter each stage. When hit by a harpoon, the balloons break down into smaller fragments, in a similar fashion to Atari's 1979 classic, "Asteroids". Players can only fire the harpoon guns virtually upwards, but can move left and right, as well as climbing the ladders that appear on many of the levels. Each of the game's fifty levels is played against a backdrop of one of seventeen famous world landmarks. All balloons must be destroyed before players can advance to the next screen. The game's levels each contain a different layout of blocks. While most of these are permanent fixtures, some disappear when shot, while others reveal hidden bonuses. Food item bonuses occasionally appear that can be collected for bonus points. Player start each stage armed with only a single-shot harpoon, but some balloons, when popped, release special weapons that drop down to the bottom of the screen. Players then have a few seconds to collect the power-up before it disappears. Available power-ups are:</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Puzz Loop is a puzzle game for one or two players in which different coloured marbles continually roll down a spiral path towards a central goal line. Players control a rotating cannon situated at the center of the spiral and must stop the line of marbles from reaching the goal by shooting matching coloured marbles into the line. If three or more marbles of the same colour are matched, they will disappear. In addition to standard marbles, bonus marbles occasionally appear that will, for example, temporarily slow down the rate the marbles' advance, or cause all marbles of a certain colour to be destroyed. Also, providing there is a clear line of sight, unwanted marbles can be fired straight out of the play area to prevent them from adding to the advancing line. All marbles must be destroyed to complete a level. The game is over once the marbles are pushed over the goal threshold.</gameplot>

There are secret items and food to be found on each level that increases the player's power and score. The power-ups themselves consist of a shield, helmet lasers, speed and jump shoes. Players will face a boss encounter every ten stages and the game ends after the 30th stage.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A multi-screen platform game in which one or two players (either co-operatively or competitively) control a cute penguin fighting against the game's equally cute enemies. The idea is to destroy all of the on-screen enemies; once this a done, a circular key will appear; the player must pick the key up, whereupon they will be teleported to another screen which represents the second part of the stage. This screen has a silver doorway; the player must carry the key to the door - avoiding or destroying the on-screen enemies - to complete the level. Playing as a loose cross between Taito's "Bubble Bobble" and Irem's "Bomber Man", each player's penguin is armed with bombs which are used to destroy the game's enemies, as well as obstructions - such as walls etc. - and barrels; the latter often revealing hidden bonuses that can be collected. Players must be careful to avoid blowing themselves and each other up when the bombs detonate. Each level contains one or more 'rotating' platforms, allowing travel between upper and lower platforms. Players and enemies can stick to the underside of a rotating platform, then rotate it through 180 degrees to reach the platform above them. The opposite applies to reach a lower platform.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>This is a puzzle game in which the aim is to move symbol-bearing blocks onto identically-symboled blocks in order to eliminate them. Blocks can only be moved left or right, or dropped downwards. The order in which the blocks are eliminated needs careful planning, as it's sometimes necessary to destroy three blocks at a time, or use blocks as bridges for other blocks. Some puzzle screens have moving background blocks that act as elevators, making careful timing essential. Should the player make a mistake and destroy or move the wrong blocks, each puzzle screen allows for a set number of 'retries' (depending on the dipswitch settings). A retry resets all tiles to their original positions. The game consists of eight levels, with each level consisting of four separate puzzle screens. Once a level has been completed, players can chose which level to tackle next. This translates into 36 separate puzzle screens to be completed in any one game, chosen from a total of 144 puzzle screens, giving the game much replay value.</gameplot>

The snowmen must throw snowballs at the enemies, eventually encasing them completely in snow. The encased enemies must them be kicked in order to destroy them. This is achieved by standing next to the snowball and pressing the "kick out" button, which sends the giant snowball flying around the screen, killing any enemies that lay in its path. During every 10th level, the players must face and defeat an end-of-level boss. A number of power-ups are available, in the form of coloured potions. The power-ups are as follows :</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Fantasia is a "Qix"-style adult puzzle game modeled heavily after the Kaneko game "Gals Panic!". It features photographic images of both Japanese and western models. The objective is to reveal 80% of the silhouetted girl's image within the time limit while avoiding the enemies. To complicate things, there is a bar with a pointer at the top of the screen. If the pointer dips below a certain level (indicated by the change in color) the image will change to that of a monster. The pointer slowly creeps towards the monster side of the bar over time and moves dramatically towards the monster side whenever the player reveals a significant piece of the silhouette. Revealing the un-silhouetted part of the image moves the pointer back towards the girl side of the bar. If a round is completed while the monster's image is shown then the round must be repeated.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>An adult variation - one of several released by the company - of the 1981 Taito classic, "Qix" (and, latterly, "Gal Panic" from Kaneko), in which players must 'colour in' sections of the background in order to reveal a digitised picture of a naked woman in an erotic pose. Like "Qix" and its sequels, Fantasia's levels are populated with a number of enemies who must be avoided or destroyed. As well as the enemies, players are also fighting against a tight time limit.</gameplot>

After every round there is a roulette game where the player can earn rewards or penalties that will take effect in the following round. After winning three rounds against a girl, the graphic becomes a photographic image of that girl.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Lady killer is an adult, puzzle game featuring eight sexy women.  The objective of the game is to dive and leap through the surface of the play area to reveal the image of the girl underneath. At the start of each level the player gets to select which girl he wants to reveal.  Her image is then shown and is then covered by the game board.  Then the level begins. The player must move to avoid the enemies while attempting to flip the tiles on the board by diving and surfacing through them.  Flipped tiles often reveal power-ups to help the player. The player is killed any time he touches or is shot by an enemy, but the player can kill enemies by flipping a tile that the enemy is standing on. Enemies will re-spawn until the level is completed. The level is completed once all of the tiles have been removed. Each girl features five states of undress and four stages. During gameplay, the girl's silhouette remains visible through the surface of the game play area and while her state of dress changes between stages, her pose and silhouette will remain the same. Each girl also has a special stage featuring a mini-game of a sliding tile game or a number selecting game. After completing the final stage for each girl, the player is shown an erotic scene for that girl and the player must wiggle the joystick left and right to advance the scene. The game is over when the player has lost all of his lives.  Upon continuing the player restarts the level he is currently on.</gameplot>

Puzzle Bang Bang was strictly a Korean game and did not have any nude images. Lup Lup Puzzle comes in English and Japanese and features the option to include nude images. Also, the pictures &amp; No Nude Girls option features a heavier rotation of Asian Bikini models. The nude options feature a decent mix of Asian and European nudes.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>This is the classic memory game played with a deck of cards laid out in a 6x10 grid. You begin by selecting a card, it turns over, and then you try to select another card that matches. If both of your cards match, then they are both taken away (and a bit of the picture is revealed underneath them). If they don't match, then they are flipped back over and you must try again. The number of chances you have is kept track of with hearts at the top of the screen, you get an extra heart each time you guess correctly, and you lose a heart each time you guess incorrectly. Matching pairs also adds time to the timer. If you lose all of your hearts or the timer runs out then it is game over. At the start of each stage (and upon every continue) a few cards are set face-up for your advantage. Also, each stage features two joker cards (represented by the current girl's head-shot). When a joker card is selected, the next card selected removes all remaining cards with the same value. During game-play, the background image is shown in gray-scale and any nipples or pubic hair shown in the image is covered over with a band-aid sprite.  Once the stage is completed, these bandages disappear and the image is shown in full-color.  Once all of a girl's stages are completed, the player is shown all of the backgrounds for that girl. The game has 8 different women to choose from, and there are four stages for each woman (the pictures get naughtier at each stage). Once all 32 of those stages are completed, you get to play several bonus stages that have pictures of several women together. This is a really fun game, despite its obvious adult trappings.</gameplot>

Each bomb clears away a nine square grid from the background. Bombs can also be used to clear gray square barriers.  But bombs do no damage to the balloons. if a balloon rolls over the bomb as it explodes then it snuffs out the explosion and reveals nothing. In order to clear the balloons the player can shoot bottle-rockets at them. The balloons explode to drop items for points or break apart into smaller balloons. Balloons labeled with a scull and crossbones cannot be killed and must be avoided. If a player is hit by the balloons then the player is killed. The game is over when the player loses all of his lives.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>WOW New Fantasia is a game in the adult "Qix"-styled Fantasia series.  It closely resembles Fantasia II but adds an international theme with it's select screen.  You can select girls from the USSR, South America, Europe, Africa, North America, and Asia. The objective, as in previous games, is to reveal 80% of the silhouetted girl's image within the time limit while avoiding the enemies. But WOW New Fantasia changes things up by removing the monster backgrounds from the game.  The game now punishes sloppy play-style by replacing the hot chick with a fat chick instead. There is a bar with a pointer at the top of the screen. If the pointer dips below a certain level (indicated by the change in color) the image will change to that of a fat chick. The pointer slowly creeps towards the fat chick side of the bar over time and moves dramatically towards the fat chick side whenever the player reveals a significant piece of the silhouette. Revealing the un-silhouetted part of the image moves the pointer back towards the hot girl side of the bar. If a round is completed while the fat chick's image is shown then the round must be repeated.</gameplot>

Destroying this legion of Swamp Dragons, Slasher Skeletons and Forces of the Undead will be the supreme challenge for the mightiest of warriors. Your place in history is 100 years before Simon Belmont's birth. Dracula is young at heart, and it will take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosones. Trevor has a power never before seen by human eyes - the power to transform into three different spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. You must perfectly time Trevor's body transformations to match up his different fighting spirits against Ultimate Evils. Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. But the most important weapon Trevor has is your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle. Never before have so many dangers confronted you at one time. And if by some miracle you triumph, you'll no longer be a mere mortal. You'll be a legend who'll live forever!</gameplot>

Mega Man - the chosen defender of the human race. For he dares to single-handedly penetrate Monsteropolis' seven separate societies to stop the rapid expansion of strange misrepresentations of humans. Mega Man's goal is monumental.

The action involves Mega Man armed only with laser beam weapons, encountering strangely-configured humanoids.

Then, a research team creates an unstoppable, indestructible law enforcement cyborg - named RoboCop. Using a wild assortment of weapons, including RoboCop's Special Issue Auto-9, you must stop every sleazeball criminal you encounter with deadly, piercing accuracy. But beware, there are forces on the street - and within O.C.P. - that will stop at nothing to see RoboCop eliminated. Make your way past 6 levels of street thugs, Boddicker and the powerful ED-209 to your final battle with Dick Jones. Prepare yourself for non-stop action in one of the most explosive games you will ever play. It's going to take more than a cop to clean up the scum of old Detroit - it's going to take RoboCop.

					<gameplot>This text refers to the Arcade version of this title.Sky Kid is a plane shooter from the developers at Namco. Laid out in a side to side scrolling format, it's your job to fly missions in enemy territory. Your objectives are to pick up bombs, drop them on strategic targets, and eliminate as many enemy forces as you can. Enemies will attack from the air and from the ground. Enemy planes attack from both the front and the rear. Trucks and other ground enemies will be mobile or stationary. Both air and ground enemies will fire missiles at your plane.During each mission, you are required to swoop down to the ground and pick up a large bomb. You must carry this bomb to the target revealed at the beginning of the level. Once there, you must drop it. If you hit the target's weakest point, it will sink into the ground and you will get a 10,000-point bonus. If you hit the target anywhere besides the weak point, you will get 500 points but no bonus. Controls in Sky Kid include two buttons and a joystick. The joystick moves the plane up, down, left, and right. One button fires your plane's missiles, and the other button causes your plane to do a backward loop. This maneuver can be used to get behind enemy planes. The loop button can also pull your plane out of a tailspin if it has been shot. Players begin the game with three airplanes. Two players can play simultaneously.</gameplot>

As the pilot of a laser base that moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen and fires vertically, you alone are powerful enough to stave off the invasion.Each wave consists of 55 invaders that are grouped in 11 columns, five aliens to a column. The group moves sideways in unison. When they reach an edge of the screen, they drop a level and begin moving in the opposite direction, and so on and so on. Your job is to destroy the invaders before they reach the bottom of the screen. If you let an enemy missile hit you or allow even one alien get too low on the playfield, you will lose a ship.The invaders in the first two rows from the bottom are worth 10 points each. You get 20 points apiece for destroying the third- and fourth-row aliens. The top row nets you 30 points per enemy. Occasionally a UFO will float by at the top of the screen. Blasting this craft out of the sky will add 50, 100, 150 or 300 points to your score.Positioned across the lower section of the screen, just above your laser base, lie four bunkers. You can hide from enemy fire behind these shelters, but they will erode a bit with every enemy missile and laser base shot received. Speaking of lasers, you can only fire one at a time. You cannot fire again until your shot is destroyed by a missile, reaches the top of the screen, or hits an invader, a UFO, or a bunker. You begin a game of Space Invaders with three lives and will receive an extra laser base for every 1,000 points you score. You should try to score as many points as possible before Earth meets its inevitable doom. The invaders won't stop coming until all your laser bases are destroyed.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The forces of light and dark are engaged in a climactic battle, and your decisions and skill will determine its outcome. Based on the computer title from Electronic Arts, Archon for NES is a board game with a twist: you must actively battle your opponent over contested squares. Each side has 18 fantasy creatures to deploy on a 9x9 checkerboard, from lowly knights and goblins to the powerful wizard and sorceress. Your goal is to either eliminate the opposing faction's units or to maintain control over five "power point" squares. When two creatures meet on the same space, a real-time battle ensues on a separate screen, with players directly controlling their character. Each square's color determines which unit, if any, receives a health advantage in combat.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Join one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history for Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball. While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox. The gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.A player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.</gameplot>

Pro All-Stars, and even the U.S.S.R.), these young Americans have a lot of work cut out for them if they are to become World Cup Champions. In Super Dodge Ball, it's up to you to help Team U.S.A. win the World Cup. You must defeat all of the teams listed above, the U.S.S.R. being the toughest, by hitting your opponents with a ball you've thrown and knocking them out of the game. Other games can be played, including a two-player "versus" mode and "bean ball," which consists of nothing more than throwing the ball at another guy who's trying to do the same to you.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>As with most Tetris sequels, Tetris 2 consists of blocks falling from the top of the screen, one after another. In the original Tetris, the object is to arrange the blocks in an unbroken horizontal line, effectively erasing them from the screen. This game, however, features red, green, and yellow blocks, and you must align three or more blocks of the same color vertically or horizontally to erase them from the screen. The game ends when the blocks pile up to the top of the screen.Tetris 2 features a simultaneous two-player mode wherein you challenge either the computer or an opponent. The object of the game is similar to the one-player mode, but you win by either making all the blocks on your screen vanish, or when the blocks on your opponent's field of play stack all the way to the top. The first player to win three games wins the match.An added challenge in Tetris 2 is the addition of fixed blocks and flash blocks. These blocks are already present on the play field when you begin a game. In the one-player game, if you eliminate a flash block, all blocks of the the same color will vanish from the screen. If you erase all flash blocks, all fixed blocks will vanish, moving you forward to the next level. In the competitive mode, every time you eliminate one of these special blocks, the size of your opponent's play field decreases, making his or her game more difficult.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>A Bug's Life is a platform game with different goals in each of 15 levels. Most of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik, to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go.Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Flik’s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.</gameplot>

While racing, they do their best to avoid various road hazards such as oncoming traffic and construction. Players chose between seven different cars to race with. As in most racing games, the car can simulate either an automatic or manual transmission. Automatic increases the speed of gear shifts, while players using the manual transmission must switch during races. Players who reach first place move on to the next track, like in most racing games. Unlike most racing games, there is the option to change the music by pressing the music button.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Madden Football 64 is the 1997 entry of EA Sports's Madden NFL franchise for the Nintendo 64.  The game is an anomaly of sorts due to the fact that unlike most entries in the series, the game lacks the NFL license, and thus none of the authentic NFL team names, logos, or other identifying characteristics are included.  However, Madden Football 64 does feature the license of the NFL Players Association, allowing the game to include the authentic rosters for each team.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Every game in the main series has a standard Party Mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many stars as possible. In every turn, each player rolls a die and progresses on the board, which usually has branching paths. Coins are primarily earned by performing well in a minigame played at the end of each turn. On most boards, players earn stars by reaching a star space and purchasing a star for a certain amount of coins. The star space appears randomly on one of several pre-determined locations and moves every time a star is purchased, usually occupying a blue space.Every Mario Party contains at least 50 to almost 110 minigames with a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which players compete individually. In 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames, players compete as two groups, cooperating to win, even though they are still competing individually in the main game. Some minigames in Mario Party are 4-player co-op, even though it doesn't say it. In most situations, winners earn ten coins each.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Mortal Kombat Trilogy uses the same story as Mortal Kombat 3, which has Shao Kahn acting as the main antagonist. Shao Kahn is presented as the millennium-old emperor of Outworld, a dark world that exists in parallel to Earth. Many years ago, the Elder Gods created the Mortal Kombat tournament in order to prevent an invasion from Outworld. For many years, Goro reigned as the supreme champion of the tournament, but eventually Liu Kang defeated him and became the new champion. Liu Kang, along with other fighters from the tournament, were drawn into Outworld and forced to compete in a new tournament. But the tournament was merely a ruse to distract the warriors from his true intentions: resurrecting Queen Sindel and taking over Earth. At the onset of the game, players must fight their way up the tournament roster, eventually reaching Shao Kahn and defeating him, thwarting his invasion and releasing many souls of fallen warriors from his body.</gameplot>

There is also a multiplayer deathmatch battle mode. There are six race tracks, four stunt arenas, eight battle arenas, and one unlockable obstacle course named The Gauntlet.

Computer players at the front of the grid would often start a third of the way around the first lap. Players started with three charges of nitrous oxide, which were used to give the player a temporary speed boost.Shortcuts were available on each track, and often the use of these decided the outcome of the races, particularly in later seasons.At the end of each race the player would be presented with a screen to allow for various upgrades to their car, such as to acceleration and handling. The player was also able to change their car for a better (or worse) vehicle and could buy extra nitrous oxide to use in the next race.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>In his evil plot to take over the Mushroom Kingdom, Fawful tricks Bowser into eating a magic mushroom. The mushroom causes Bowser to begin inhaling everything around him, including Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach! Do the Mario Bros. have the guts to rescue Peach and escape? Players are in control of two separate storylines. One features Bowser and his efforts to stop an arch-villain from taking over his castle. Meanwhile, inside Bowser, the microbe-sized Mario &amp; Luigi must muscle their way through challenges and keep their nerve if they want to find a way out. They take action to control Bowser from the inside - but without his knowledge. Players can switch between storylines at will. What happens inside Bowser affects what he's doing on the outside. Sometimes Mario &amp; Luigi must solve puzzles and challenges behind the scenes to help Bowser overcome various obstacles and advance the plot. Players must make well-timed button presses to enhance their performance during battles and challenges. In some battles, Bowser grows so large that players must turn their Nintendo DS or Nintendo DSi system sideways, blow into the microphone or tap on the touch screen with the stylus to keep up with the action. The game features the same hilarious dialogue that has been the hallmark of the Mario &amp; Luigi series.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Alex Kidd in Shinobi World is Sega's largely successful attempt to mesh the worlds of two of their flagship Sega Master System titles: Shinobi and Alex Kidd in Miracle World, with the emphasis being on the latter game's Super Mario Bros.-style platforming action. Alex journeys through the game's 12 stages, running, jumping, swimming and slashing, while exploring city streets filled with ninja, evil henchmen, high-rise scaffoldings, underground caverns, dangerous jungles, and bodies of water filled with not-so-friendly marine life. The cute, top-of-the-line graphics present everything in a cartoonlike, super-deformed style, and the music is an agreeable combination of tunes from Shinobi sped up with an Alex Kidd style of beat. The only real problem with the game is that everything, from the secret entrances to the attack patterns for bosses to the jumps, is obvious, making the levels too easy for older, more experienced Kidds.</gameplot>

Each match of three or more will remove the colorful gems from the playing field, as additional columns fall from the top of the screen. Create combo chains to improve your high score and advance to more challenging, faster-paced levels. In addition to the main play mode, where you attempt to clear jewels for as long as possible before the columns eventually block the top of the screen, a "Flash Columns" option is included that involves solving puzzles by removing a flashing jewel before time expires. Columns features both solo and head-to-head play against a friend. Multiple difficulty settings and starting levels are included for a custom challenge.</gameplot>

In order to carry out this plan, his thugs were ordered to kidnap every child on the planet! Why? To use them as slaves, of course! Only one person is brave enough to challenge him: Michael Jackson, a.k.a. Moonwalker. Play as the famous pop singer through 15 levels of musical action set across five stages.While your goal is to rescue each level's hidden children before time runs out, you'll have to face a variety of enemies trying to thwart your progress, from mobsters in Club 30, Dobermans on the Street, zombies and ghouls in the Woods, and spiders in the Caverns, to the heavily armed troops in the aptly named Enemy Hideout.Michael Jackson is known for his slick moves, so you'll be able to spin, Moonwalk, hat toss (similar to a boomerang), punch, jump, and perform the "ultimate" technique to dispose of your enemies: the Dance Attack. Once used, this attack will cause everyone on the screen to stop what they're doing and start moving to the beat!Each method of attack will drain Michael's magic meter, however, so you'll have to keep it at full strength by rescuing children. As you might expect, the game features several of the singer's chart-topping songs, including "Smooth Criminal," "Beat It," "Billie Jean," "Another Part of Me," and "Bad." Watch for a cameo by Bubbles the chimp!</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Phantasy Star is set on the planet Palma, one of the three known planets in the Algo Star System, located deep in the Andromeda galaxy. The game takes place in the Phantasy Star time of Space Century 342.Two hundred years earlier, space travel had been discovered, allowing for the colonization of two other planets in the galaxy, Motavia and Dezoris. Now, life was good under the rule of King Lassic and citizens were provided with everything that they could want.Unfortunately, this peace and prosperity did not last. The first change began with a new religion that was rumored to have come from another galaxy. The dark priests of this new religion, though never actually seen by mortal man, supposedly promised immortality to any who would join their cause.King Lassic was getting old and the idea of living forever appealed to him. He became the first to join this new religion. Soon after, he was changed. The change started with a horrific suit of armor that the priests made for him.

					<gameplot>This text refers to the Arcade version of this title.Rastan is a side-scrolling weapon-based fighting game in which players must lead the Conan the Barbarian-like warrior through level after level of fiendish monsters and diabolical traps. Along the way, there are several objects which Rastan can pick up to aid him on his quest. At the start of his journey he is equipped with a basic sword, but can acquire a long-reaching axe, an even-longer-reaching hammer, and the ultimate weapon, a fireball-throwing longsword.Defensively users can pick up a shield, a mantle (cloak) or armature (armor) to reduce damage. Pick up blue potions to regain health, but watch out for poison. Picking up a ram's head will increase overall maximum life force. Other items include a ring for faster weapon attacks, a necklace for double points, jewels for bonus points, and a rod which has varied effects.The variety of enemies to defeat include snakes, green salamander men, club-throwing multi-armed blue humanoids, fire-breathing manticors, demons, harpies, piranhas, minotaurs, evil wizards, small and giant bats, and skeleton warriors to name but a few. At the end of each level a boss enemy must be defeated to gain admittance to the next level.Rastan will also encounter many traps including spikes from the ceiling, walls and floor, crushing doors, acid pits, water pits, fire pits, and rolling boulders. Players start the game with three warriors. When the life meter runs out or Rastan falls into any of the pit traps, his life ends. Extra men are earned every 100,000 points. The game can be continued an infinite number of times until the final level which  must be completed on one quarter.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Enter a dark and dystopian future where humanity's only savior from a malevolent supercomputer and army of robotic soldiers is a half man, half machine cyborg programmed with three primary directives; Serve the public trust, protect the innocent and uphold the law. Fortunately for us, donuts don't rank very high on this police officer's list of priorities. Based on the Dark Horse Comics miniseries by Frank Miller, which in turn was based upon characters from the cyberpunk film franchises RoboCop and The Terminator, RoboCop Versus The Terminator brings both worlds together in a metallic clash for the future of humanity. In a hypothetical future outside of the film continuities, you're placed in the role of RoboCop on a mission to destroy the SkyNet supercomputer. Seeing humans as a threat, this computer-gone-bad wants us ("us" hopefully being human, right?) extinct and has constructed an army of human-like Terminator cyborgs to get the job done. You're not going to simply knock on SkyNet's door and politely ask to be let in, however; you're going to have to battle your way through eleven levels of urban and industrial chaos.Playing from a side-scrolling perspective, you'll guide the man of steel and Kevlar through each level, completing primary and secondary objectives. From saving hostages and taking down monstrous cyborgs to simply collecting power-ups and keeping your shiny metal butt unscathed, the higher your performance in these tasks, the higher your score. A host of the usual thugs and goons are ready to do some damage, while automated guns spraying you with bullets, persistently attacking endoskeletons, floating metallic orbs and an army of other foes -- human and robot alike -- are attempting to put you down for the count. If this weren't enough, each level is littered with deadly hazards such as barrels of toxic waste, flame jets and more. In addition, end-of-level bosses such as ED-209 or a T-800 Terminator will greet you nicely, then try to blow you away, so please respond in kind.RoboCop is agile in this alternate future; he can climb up ladders or chains, hang from wires and jump off platforms whilst firing in nine directions at foes. An assortment of powerful weaponry allowing you to even up the odds may be collected, such as rocket launchers, plasma rifles and of course, the ubiquitous laser gun. In addition to these, you can snag a Robo-Head giving you an extra life, shields endowing you with temporary invulnerability and yummy pots of paste that somehow replenish your life -- maybe our police officer pal prefers gruel over chocolate and sprinkles? RoboCop also appears to have an attitude in this alternate reality, as digitized voice clips are used, such as his exclaiming "Terminated!" upon destruction of a T-800 Terminator. Ah, the irony...</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Based on the 1985 arcade game (simply titled Space Harrier), Space Harrier 3-D is a Master System exclusive with all new stages and is designed for use with the system's SegaScope 3-D Glasses. The pseudo 3D effect gives the game a sharper appearance than the standard version of Space Harrier for the Master System, but gameplay is essentially the same (if easier to see), and the graphics are still somewhat blocky and roughly animated in comparison to the original arcade game. Still, it's an intense, enjoyably mindless shooter.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Designed for use with Sega's SegaScope 3-D Glasses, Zaxxon 3-D is based on Zaxxon, the classic isometric shooter that was popular in the arcades and on home systems in the early 1980s. This time, however, the outer space action is from a first person, 3D perspective.Two thousand years of galactic peace has come to an end as the evil Vargan Military Empire has declared war on Earth. A vicious, yet intelligent race, the Vargans have built a line of space battle fortresses reaching for our planet, each equipped with fuel tanks, cannon batteries and homing missiles. Each fortress hides a powerful Mothership and is protected by Vargan Death Fighters.Against all odds, you must commandeer a Zaxxon fighting ship on a one-man mission to restore peace to the galaxy. In each of nine levels of play, you must shoot your way past enemy Death Fighters, run the gauntlet in the enemy battle fortress, and defeat the Vargan Mothership. "Running the gauntlet" consists of piloting a ship over, around, and through a series of walls and magnetic barriers. Other obstacles and enemies include cannon batteries, tanks, homing missiles and base missiles.As you fly through the fortresses, you must shoot fuel tanks to restore your fuel supply. You can also grab power up capsules that give you increased fuel tank capacity, extra lives, heightened speed, increased weapon power and extra weapons. There are three types of upgraded, changeable shots: Nuclear, Hyper and Miracle. When you are on target, a firing sight will appear onscreen. Keep in mind that firing shots uses extra fuel in this exclusive release for the Sega Master System.</gameplot>

Unlike X4, however, after you finish the opening tutorial stage, you can go into the Maverick stages with either X or Zero, so you aren't making such a difficult choice at the beginning. Each stage has multiple obstacles that are exclusive to that stage, and usually have more than one section to them.</gameplot>

The game features a "Nightmare" system, which makes it so that when you defeat a Maverick, their icon on the level select screen will become red, which means that certain environmental hazards will be added to the level to increase difficulty. This is important because this game has many more hidden secrets to find than the other games in the X series.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The second game in the series departs somewhat dramatically from its predecessor in terms of the overall gameplay model. Parasite Eve II plays much more like an action game than an RPG, which is a fairly radical departure when compared side-by-side.The RPG elements are intact in some form or another, as the health points and mitochondria points are used once again, but it is mostly the experience points that encourage RPG-style gameplay.Perhaps the biggest departure from the original title is the removal of the ATB (Active Time Bar), thus eliminating the turn-based combat. The combat is now rendered completely in real-time, which allows more freedom for the player but also serves to alienate more ardent RPG fans.The weapons and armor customization has been downgraded somewhat, but also expanded in scope to include many more options--just with much less depth. Ammo is practically unlimited, as nearly every area has a limitless supply available that mostly prevents gamers from getting backed against the wall against enemies.Parasite Energy has returned, but has been specialized into more compartmentalized sections. Fire and Wind serve as Aya's offensive options, while the elements of Water and Earth compose what could be considered her defensive measures. There are a number of both old and new Parasite Energy skills, most of which are vital to completing the game.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The game marks a departure from the top down interface of the previous games, instead utilising a 3D engine and allowing for direct control over followers. This entry places the player in the shoes of a female Shaman, in command of a tribe on a quest for control of the solar system.Battling against three other Shamans who are in command of the opposing Dakini, Chumara and Matak tribes, you must wrest control of the 24 planets which serve as the games levels. Upon the way the player is able to use spells, courtesy of Stone Heads initially which require worship in order to dispense a set number to the players advantage. Most spells become unlocked after the Shaman enters the Vault of Knowledge with the spells symbol above it and extracts the essence of the spell. Further Vaults also unlock buildings which allow the player to create stronger warriors, preachers to convert the wild men and braves from the other tribes and spies to add an espionage element to the game.Upon completing the 24th level, the players Shaman becomes a God, and the 25th and final level becomes a free for all in which the player battles against all three other tribes in order to control the Solar System. The player is in this level omnipotent, able to cast spells an unlimited amount of times and from anywhere on the battlefield.An expansion called Undiscovered Worlds was released in 1999, continuing the story after the main campaign. You play as a new Shaman in the same timeline as the last game, who has to restore peace to the Solar System.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Fighting Force was released in 1997 for the PlayStation by Core Design, the creators of Tomb Raider. You have four characters to pick from, Hawk, Smasher, Alana, and Mace. They all have pretty much the same moves but each character has different aerial and special moves. You fight through 7 stages, with 22 levels. One memorable feature is the option to tear street posts and railings from their foundations and use them as weaponry. Car trunks can also be hit open to drop numerous other weapons.In structure, the game is a return to the form of classic brawlers like Final Fight. The game implemented the classic mechanics of old-school brawlers where when a certain button is pushed, health is sacrificed to perform a special move. The game, like most brawlers, is pretty much devoid of plot, with the only real purpose to get to the end of the level where the boss is.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Gauntlet makes the transition to 3D in this enhanced follow-up to 1985's four-player fantasy action title. Lead a warrior, wizard, valkyrie, or archer in fast-paced combat against ghosts, demons, and sorcerers spawned from monster generators. A perspective above the battlefield lets you explore over 30 maze-like levels together with a friend. In a twist from the original Gauntlet, characters increase in level and earn experience points used to improve ratings in strength, speed, armor, and health. Your objective is to travel through seven themed worlds to defeat an evil demon named Skorne. Food, special weapons, potions, and items can be acquired, stored, and accessed whenever needed. Enhance your offensive capabilities with three-way shots, fire breath, and super shots, or temporarily invoke such powers as super speed and invisibility. Hidden throughout the trap-filled territory are switches, scrolls, and legend weapons. Switches reveal secret rooms, scrolls offer helpful information, and legend weapons let you exploit weaknesses of boss creatures.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The gameplay is similar to the previous games, but with some additions. The main priority is the player picks a level and fights the end boss; Mega Man will earn a weapon for defeating the boss. Rush also returns with some special abilities. Also returning from Mega Man 7 is the item store.Like Mega Man 7, only four robot masters are available at the start. After the player beats the first four, the other four will appear. The weapons earned from the first four robot masters play a big role in the other four levels; for example, in Search Man's stage, the thunder claw that was earned from Clown Man, is used to get through spiked gaps by using the thunder claw to grab on to metal poles and swing to the other side.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Need for Speed returns with all the exotic supercars, tracks, and race modes you've come to expect--but reengineered for higher performance, stunning realism, and fierce competition.  With Hot Pursuit mode, you can race on both sides of the law: as a cop using radar, dispatchers, and roadblocks to track down speeders; or as a racer, trying to outrun the law.  Real-world environments feature details such as blowing leaves, rain, lightning, mud splashes, and smoke from burning rubber and they will put your driving skills to the ultimate test.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Small Soldiers is a third-person action game. Instead of following the plot of the movie and showing the Gorgonites fighting the Commandos in houses and gardens, the game is set in the land of Gorgon, homeworld to the Gorgonites, as described on the back of the action figure's boxes in the film.There are fourteen levels in the single player campaign, that follows Archer and his fellow Gorgonites as they try to defend their homeworld from the invading army of Commandos. The game is a mix of platforming and third-person combat, with the player being able to jump and traverse ledges in the platforming sections, and fight using Archer's crossbow and 13 other weapons when in combat. Many levels involve freeing captured Gorgonites who will then join you in battle against the Commandos. Multiplayer includes two head-to-head two-player Chip vs. Archer modes where you either need to capture flags or get a set amount of frags.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is a skateboarding game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision (under their Activision o2 label) for the PlayStation 2 (on October 28, 2001), GameCube (on November 13, 2001), and Xbox (on March 4, 2002). The third installment of the long-running Tony Hawk franchise and the sequel to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 adds new skaters and levels while introducing new gameplay elements (such as new hidden variations of normal tricks and the Revert, a ground trick that can be executed as soon as the player hits the ground from a quarter-pipe, allowing them to continue from a Vert combo chain), and online multiplayer for up to four players (PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions only). The Career Mode currency system from the predecessor is removed (unlocking levels now just require objective completion, while stat increase points and new decks are gained by picking up special pickups scattered throughout levels).</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The core skating mechanics are mostly unchanged from previous games, but one major new feature is the spine transfer, which allows players to either switch to a ramp on the other side of a vert, level off when launched away from a ramp, or land correctly into a ramp if entering from a flat area.Also new to the game are pogo tricks, performed during manuals by tapping one of the face buttons. Depending on the trick, the skater will perform a handstand on the board or stand on the side of the board. Extensive use of the pogo system is effective during combos.The way goals are received is much different from previous games, adopting a sandbox-style system where goals are given by characters around the level. Completing a goal is rewarded with stat points that can assigned, and sometimes special trick slots. The game also reintroduces the concept of money, which was present in THPS 2 but not 3. Small amounts of money can be found throughout the level, usually by going up a ramp or grinding rails.Each skater, including the custom skater, has a unique "end" goal, which is often very elaborate. Completion of the goal nets a highlight video of the chosen skater, if using a pro skater.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>The game opens with a silent movie-style cutscene in which it conveys the biography of Sweet Tooth, the long-time star of the series. The Twisted Metal carnival of vehicular combat and destruction arrives in young Sweet Tooth's town, prompting him to enter into the tournament. This competition is held by the leader, Calypso, who promises "any wish the victor could possibly desire" as a grand prize. The cost of losing though, is the participant's immortal soul. Sweet Tooth creates his insane, clown-like persona and enters the contest. He soon rises to the top, and wins, in his machine-gun outfitted ice cream truck. Upon winning the contest, he enters Calypso's trailer and wishes to be "the star of Twisted Metal." Calypso grants Sweet Tooth's wish, which is used to explain his head of flames. From then on, Sweet Tooth competes and wins each and every tournament he enters, remaining the top contestant. That is, until he begins to envy Calypso's position as the carnival's master of ceremonies. At this point, he overthrows Calypso, and takes control of his empire with the help of his clown minions. This is where the player's story begins.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Aspects of the classic game, like building armies and seizing territories, are brought to life through animation and graphics. The version also offers a variation on the classic game, titled Ultimate Risk, which further enhances gameplay by including weather, terrain, POWs, and more, features not possible with the limitations of the board version. These features add a new dynamic to the already challenging game by forcing users to consider alternate strategies from the original fbme version.Five maps are available for strategizing, including the classic world map with six continents and the American map, with 14 additional countries and 153 territories. If playing the classic version, players choose from three varying game objectives. In World Domination, the last player standing wins the game, while the Capital Risk module establishes a goal of conquering the opposing player's secretly designated capital. The last objective, Mission Risk, involves completing a mission designated by drawing a random card.</gameplot>

Well, they FINALLY added some proper challenge to the game - a snap for me of course. AND THE STORY? You sure ask a lot of questions, kid! Kaptain K. Rool and his cruelest cut-throat Kremlings have kidnapped that flea-bitten ape Donkey Kong. I figured I'd rescue him when the little pip-squeak DIDDY pops up along with his girlfriend, and they head off fixin' to prove themselves heroes or something. Come to think of it, I haven't laid eyes on those two for quite a while. I just may have to help them out after all!</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Crime ridden, gang infested Metro City has elected a new mayor. But this mayor is not like the others that have come before. He is Mike Haggar, a former professional wrestler and street fighter. The gangs have been unable to bribe him to let them have their way in the city, so the Mad Gear gang, the most powerful of them all, has kidnapped his daughter Jessica.Now, Mike Haggar is out for revenge. He and his friend Cody (a fifth degree black belt in Karate) must fight their way through five sections of the city to rescue Jessica and rid Metro City of its gang influence.Final Fight for the Super NES is a one-player port of the 1989 Capcom coin-op game. While the arcade original has three playable characters, the Super NES version has only two, dropping Guy and keeping Cody and Mike Haggar. As either of these two fighters you must work your way through the city, using punches, kicks, jumping kicks and throws to cut a swath through the gang members in your way. In desperate situations you can employ a special attack that hits everyone around you, but at the cost of a small percentage of your health. You can uncover a variety of useful items by beating down thugs or destroying phone booths, billboards and barrels. Usable items include pizza, grapes, apples and other food that can be eaten for health, jewelry and cash that can be picked up for points, and weapons (such as knives, pipes and swords) that can be used on thugs.</gameplot>

Whether it was dinosaur demolition or pterodactyl hang-glidin', life for the boys was pretty cool. Cool, that is, until a bogus bunch of neanderthal nerds crashed their village and scared off all the cave-babes. Now the cave-babes are out there- SOMEWHERE, lost and reeeeally lonely... so what are you waitin' for? It's up to Joe and Mac to get 'em back.</gameplot>

A humungoso flying android screams out of the sky and rips Lady Liberty from her foundation, sending hundreds of freaked out tourists into the harbor below. "No way!" cries Raphael. "Way," replies Donatello. And the crazy quantum chase is on! Journey through ten levels of enormous arcade graphics, the largest and craziest talking Turtles ever with eons of bodacious battlegrounds, from prehistoric to futuristic galaxies. To prepare for the toughest Shred-heads you've ever seen, try the Versus mode, a Turtle-on-Turtle combat arena that finally proves who's the mightiest mutant of all. Also test your slice-em-up speed in the Time Trials mode to find out how fast you can clear three courses. Get ready for the 3-D jab and toss that sends enemies flying right in your face. Mondo body slams and pizza power bonuses make you more Turtle than ever before. You better believe you're going to need it. Shredder's out for Turtle hide. And he's got all the time in the world to get it.</gameplot>

Even as the crews prepare to fight, industrial and military space complexes disappear, one by one.

It's Zelos, an all-engulfing, planet-eating alien who's hungering to take a bite out of you! Only this time you don't have to rescue the millions of Gradians alone. You can call on a starfighter friend from the planet Latis, who'll fight beside you in his RoadBritish space destroyer. You'll both be gunning for max power-ups, with ripple lasers, plutonic missiles and impregnable force fields. But you better be on target. For this isn't your ordinary space scum. And to crush him you've gotta soar through his guts, blast past his death traps and ultimately blow out his heart. Good luck, Commander. The galaxy's counting on you!</gameplot>

The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Welcome to the future. In the early 21st century, gang warfare and crime have lead to the creation of privatised law enforcement. The Anti-Crime Network (ACN) employs bounty hunters known as ‘Headhunters’ to track down the most wanted criminals, using combat skills and high-tech weaponry. You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you’ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough… Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection. Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license. As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Tokyo-to, a city not unlike Tokyo, somewhere in Asia, in the near future. This is the story about the GG's, one of three rival teenage gangs who ride motorised inline skates and are tagging the streets with graffiti. There is a turf war going on between the gangs GG's, the Poison Jam, and the high-tech freaks, the Noise Tanks. The evil Rokkaku Corporation has the corrupt police in their grasp, and, headed by Captain Onishima, the cops are hell-bent on subduing the unruly teen protagonists. But there is light in the darkness: the underground DJ, "Professor K," and his Jet Set Radio station keep tabs on what is happening on the streets of Tokyo-to, and soon our teens will have something much darker than the police to worry about.[CR]As one of the GG's, you skate through a variety of different levels, from busy streets to run-down rooftops and smelly sewers where you learn new moves, collect spray cans, and tag the streets with graffiti. New graffiti designs can be unlocked by finding "Graffiti Souls" in levels, by designing new graffiti yourself, or by going online and downloading any images you find while browsing the internet. Fight the rival gangs "Poison Jam" and the "Noise Tanks", the evil mega-corporation Rokkaku and their police cronies in this fresh take on the platform genre, mixing traditional platform elements with skating similar to that of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games. Players are scored on their performance in a level, both on the level of graffiti attempted as well as optional tags and skating tricks. As the game progresses challenge maps open that test the player's ability to do larger tags, more tricks, or race against an opponent.[CR]The American and European release contained two new levels based on New York. The story and order that you meet characters was modified to include these two levels. Both releases also have different unique soundtracks for these levels.[CR][CR]The 2012 HD version has widescreen HD graphics and a new camera system, as well as all the original songs but one.</gameplot>

The game follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player views the environments from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. He can also shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will, but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.</gameplot>

These challenges are in sets of ten (called Chapters - there are 25 in total), with completion of all challenges opening the next chapter (assuming the player has enough Kudos, see below) and unlocking a new car. Each challenge is on a different track, and unlocking a challenge unlocks that track in the time-attack and multiplayer modes.</gameplot>

Rayman has been captured by the pirates as well and is lamenting his troubles in his prison cell, when he meets his good friend, Globox. Globox has smuggled in a silver Lum, given to him by the great fairy, Ly. With the power of the silver Lum, Rayman is able to once more shoot his fists. With his power restored, the pair escape the flying prison ship and embark on another adventure to save the entire world![CR]Rayman 2: The Great Escape is the sequel to Rayman, a 2D side-scrolling platform game. Unlike the previous game, Rayman 2 is entirely in free-roaming 3D environments, similar to Super Mario 64. Rayman has many unique abilities that can help him get around the world. In addition to being able to shoot his fists, he can use his hair to hover like a helicopter, and even glide on air currents in certain places. He can climb certain walls and ceilings and can even use his fists to swing from special purple Lums which are shaped like rings. Rayman also has many unique items at his disposal, such as powder kegs which can be carried or fly like jets, strange warheads with legs that he can ride and steer like bucking mules, and gigantic plums that can be thrown into the water to create new paths.[CR]Rayman's goal is to find the four masks of the world, which allow the owner to reawaken Polokus, the spirit of the world. These masks are scattered far and wide, and are well hidden and guarded, so it is not an easy task. By gathering the yellow Lums, Rayman will gain access to new worlds, which will take him to the locations of new masks. Collecting yellow Lums also rewards him with new powers and life meter extensions.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>If you like a little style and originality in your first-person shooters, look no further than REZ. Taking the genre to its most viscerally extremes, the game gets most of its luster from its incredible storyline: The information age comes to a deadly halt when the core of society's technological memory an AI unit called Eden begins to feel the strain of too much data. Struggling to keep up, the technology actually begins to question its own existence and goes into a futuristic freak out. Now, you must journey deep into the realm of 3D cyberspace in order to fix the system, a task that will require hacking codes and battling fierce creatures.

					<gameplot>On a November day when the snow turned to rain, Ryu Hazuki arrives home just in time to see his father killed by Lan Di, a man Ryu's father obviously knew very well. Ryu attempts to stop Lan Di, but is effortlessly beaten to within an inch of his life. After recovering from his injuries Ryu sets out to track down his father's murderer, as well as uncover his family's secrets and the mystery of the Phoenix and Dragon mirrors that Lan Di seeks.[CR]Shenmue is a hybrid game that incorporates elements of adventure and fighting with light role-playing. The game is set in a 3D environment that can be freely explored by the player. Much of the gameplay involves talking to Ryu's friends and the various people around town, hoping to find hints or clues that lead to the next step in the story. Any details Ryu learns are written down in his notebook for future review. Ryu can buy items from stores or try his luck with capsule toy machines, but most items that can be bought have no purpose outside of filling his inventory. Ryu can also visit an arcade and play accurate versions of Hang-On and Space Harrier, as well as games like darts and pool.</gameplot>

Taking the genre to its most viscerally extremes, the game gets most of its luster from its incredible storyline: The information age comes to a deadly halt when the core of society's technological memory an AI unit called Eden begins to feel the strain of too much data. Struggling to keep up, the technology actually begins to question its own existence and goes into a futuristic freak out. Now, you must journey deep into the realm of 3D cyberspace in order to fix the system, a task that will require hacking codes and battling fierce creatures.

					<gameplot>Arcadia is a world where continents float high above, and people travel by airships. Among the countries of this world, the most powerful one is the Empire of Valua. Guided by its greedy admirals, Valua strives to possess all the power in Arcadia. The boy Vyse and the girl Aika are members of the Blue Rogues - noble pirates who attack only Valuan war ships. During one of their confrontations with a battle ship, they encounter a girl named Fina, who is on an important mission whose secret she cannot tell yet. Involved in the conflict with the Empire of Valua, the trio of the heroes must explore the whole world of Arcadia in order to defeat the admirals.[CR]Skies of Arcadia is a traditional Japanese role-playing game with turn-based combat and randomly appearing enemies. Player-controlled party contains up to four active combatants. During battles, characters attack physically, use items, or cast magic spells, which deplete magic points as well as spirit points (SP). Each character is also able to "focus", which restores spirit points. Once the common spirit bar is filled, characters can unleash powerful special attacks. Enemies may be resilient or vulnerable to particular elements; elemental affinities of weapons can be switched at any time during battles.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Yet again Sonic and friends find themselves wrapped up in the schemes of Dr. Robotnik. This time he plans to exploit the power of Chaos, a malevolent being that feeds upon the power of the Chaos Emeralds. In their own ways five heroes will do what they can to save Station Square and, perhaps, the entire world.[CR]The player can select from which character to play after meeting them with Sonic, and each has their own unique version of each level. Sonic's levels involve racing through a level as quickly as possible, destroying any robots along the way. Tails can hover over distances, and his levels are similar to Sonic's except that he must beat an opponent to the finish line. Amy can't charge up ramps or run as quickly as Sonic and Tails, but she does have a giant hammer she can break obstacles with. The goal of her levels is to avoid being captured by a robot sent after her by Dr. Robotnik. E102 Gamma is a slow, difficult to maneuver robot, but it has guns and missiles that can lock on to several targets at once, chaining together attacks and earning a higher score and more time on the clock. The goal of its levels is to reach a boss enemy and destroy it before time runs out. The final character is Big the Cat, a fisherman searching for his lost frog. Big's levels are almost entirely devoid of action or fighting; he just fishes. Each character can find items that increase their abilities as the story progresses, such as a ring for Sonic that lets him home along lines of rings, or improved lures for Big. A final chapter wrapping up the story is unlocked after all other characters have been completed.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>4 Wheel Thunder is the off-road racing sequel to the power-boat racing game Hydro Thunder. [CR]In this game, players race around two types of courses; huge outdoor tracks and smaller indoor tracks. All in all, there are 24 areas in which to race, including various day/night and rain/sunshine variations. The game includes the standard championship, practice race, and two player modes.[CR]The Thunder series of games is unique in that the key to winning the race lies not in careful steering and braking, instead focusing more in finding the boost power-ups that lie around the tracks. Each boost icon adds a few seconds of time to your boost meter. The player then can press a boost button to increase the speed of the truck dramatically. Without using boost power-ups, the player has no chance of winning a race.</gameplot>

These different grooves alter the character's abilities to resemble different Capcom or SNK games. There are three grooves dedicated for each company, and even the option to define a custom groove.[CR]The "EO" of the GameCube and Xbox titles refers to a new groove: Easy Operation. Instead of the normal inputs needed to do special and super moves, these moves are instead done automatically by tapping the right thumb-stick in specific directions. Only a small part of each character's moveset can be accessed this way, however, and if the player does not select EO then the game will play the same as the arcade and previous releases.</gameplot>

The home version does include some mini-games and training modes that were not in the arcade version of the game.</gameplot>

A pounding music soundtrack kicks in as you are slapped into your car to await the green light. The game offers both a traditional arcade mode with checkpoint time splits and a special PC mode that pits you against the other cars over different race distances. The PC mode also offers more car choices, with a variety of speed, acceleration, and grip characteristics. It even rewards successful players (meaning those finishing first, second, or third in the difficult setting) by offering up to ten more upgraded cars to drive.

Unlike Tekken Tag Tournament, however, DOA2 also includes a single player mode, a dodge button (allowing you to move left and right away from attacks), and multi-level arenas.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Expendable is a light-gun compatible shooting game most easily likened to Sega's Virtua Cop series. You play as either Howard Gibson or Jean Clifford, both super-agents a la James Bond, and you are taken through scenarios shooting enemies and attempting to avoid civilian casualties.[CR]The game is a home version of the coin operated arcade machine, and is playable by one or two players. The game includes the popular features of the Virtua Cop series "Justice Shot" (in which you shoot an enemy's gun or gun arm instead of killing them) and the "Combo Shot" in which you can hit an enemy with up to three shots before they expire. The home version does include some mini-games and training modes that were not in the arcade version of the game.</gameplot>

The most obvious point is that although most planes come from real World War 2 aircraft, the theatre of operations is a bit unique; The four major sides to the conflict (American, British, German, Japanese) are all fighting one another over a group of islands somewhere in the Pacific. Thus each of these nations is represented in close proximity and in direct conflict to one another.[CR]The gameplay takes place over a series of single-player flight missions in which your American pilot will fight against the Axis forces and ally with the British. The majority of the missions take place in the air against other aerial targets.</gameplot>

As the music plays, the player must shake the maracas in the appropriate region with proper timing to progress. A standard controller can also be used if you do not have the maracas controller, which is sold separately.[CR]The music in the game comes from a wide variety of sources. Some of the songs are traditional samba music, while others are recognizable pop tunes, like "Macarena" and "Tequila."</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Look out -- Wham! Bam! And a full-body Slam! This Dreamcast version of Sega's revolutionary fighting game packs a one-two-three punch. As one of 12 fierce characters, you have a single deadly goal: to kick some 3D ass 'til you win the World Fighting Tournament. Incredible 3D environments, fluid gameplay, and lifelike graphics enhance the smooth fighting moves you're used to in the mega-hit arcade original. An exclusive feature of the Dreamcast version is Team Battle Mode, in which your custom three-person team goes head-to-head with an opponent's custom team. Virtua Fighter 3tb is so realistic that characters actually watch their opponents' every life-like move, like when they fall forward FROM behind or lose their balance when pushed. Focus your razor-sharp reflexes and take lethal aim as you deliver bone-crunching blows to your reeling opponents. When the dust settles, you'll still be standing.</gameplot>

Players progress through different levels attempting to destroy their opponents by strategically planting bombs and running for cover. Each playing field is constructed out of both destructible and indestructible walls, and it's up to you to position bombs in the right place at the right time. The action gets frantic as alliances and rivalries are made and then broken. Intense battles unfold online when you connect to the Internet and play other Bomberman Online users in Internet battle mode. The new screen-scroll option displays a larger map, making it possible for numerous players to skillfully battle it out at the same time. Five new stages and four new ways to play add to the fun, creating an endless chain reaction of unique and dramatic battles!</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Sonic Shuffle is a multiplayer party game, similar to the Mario Party style of games on Nintendo consoles, which was released on the Dreamcast. Sonic Shuffle is a bright colorful game that uses a cel-shaded style for the characters and animations.[CR]Sonic Shuffle is played out on a board between four characters, which can be either player or computer controlled. Player's must work their way around the game board in order to earn emblems, which are automatically awarded for finding the Precious Stones, completing events, collecting the most rings and other tasks. The player at the end of the game with the most emblem's wins. However, the main focus of the game is to be the player that finds the five Precious Stones that are randomly placed around the board in turn for the player to find.[CR]Each player is given a stack of numbered cards which are hidden from the view of other players, and are used to move around the board. Two other cards are also hidden in a player's deck, including the S card, which grants the player extra options such as stealing the cards off other players, and the Eggman card, which when accidentally picked will summon a roulette that will randomly pick punishments as devised by Dr Eggman, such as making ring spaces smaller, or dropping an anvil on a player so that they lose rings, and so on.[CR]Spread across the board are different spaces which activate different events and bonuses. These are ring spaces, which earn you rings, minus-ring spaces, which cause you to lose rings, Event spaces which will trigger and event or mini-game where certain tasks are given to each player, Shop spaces where player's can trade their rings for useful items, and Battle spaces, where players use their cards to battle an enemy by selecting a card that is equal to, or higher than the enemy's card number. When landing on a Precious Stone space, the enemy guarding the Precious Stone must be defeated in this way in order to acquire the Precious Stone.[CR]There are a wide variety of mini-games and events, which are not only triggered by landing on an Event space, but each stage also has their own stage mini-game which is randomly triggered during the stage, known as 'Accidents' and is played at the end of each stage in order to earn an extra emblem. Multiplayer events that are triggered by other player's or computer controlled character's are played out by everyone and usually give the player an opportunity to earn extra rings.[CR]Sonic Shuffle also has a section called 'Sonic's Room' which is used to access bonuses such as artwork and music, and can be used as a record of completed events. Rings that are collected at the end of each stage are totalled and used to buy extras and artwork within Sonic's Room, and is thus used to unlock extra characters.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Tee Off Golf is a surprisingly satisfying sleeper hit golf game for the Dreamcast from the folks at Bottom Up. Although it does not have the realism of lets say, the "Tiger Woods" series, it still holds up pretty well without real life professional golfers. The cartoon-like characters and overly obscure body models seem to work quite well with its overall loose and subtle comical tone. Tee Off never takes itself too seriously. For example, the quirky comments after a hole in one or when simply hitting the ball vary from character to character. Not only are the characters physically distinct from one another, but also have vocal distinctions. Each character has a special tone of voice that matches the characters age, and possibly social status. For example, Randy, has a brute voice that reflects his muscular appearance, but also has a gentle softness that finishes smoothly with each word of dialogue.</gameplot>

					<gameplot>Directly translated from the popular arcade stand-up, Virtua Tennis offers a light-year jump from the Pong-style tennis of yesteryear. Sporting rich 3-D graphics, crisp animation, and realistic sound effects, you'll swear you're courtside at a grand slam. But, thanks to the game's simple controls, you won't have to spend years at a tennis camp just learning a backhand. The game features hard-top, grass, and clay surfaces, all with distinct ball-bounce and sound responses. Choose one of eight internationally ranked tennis pros and play against advanced computer opponents, or plug an extra controller in and play a friend head to head. Just as in real championships, ball boys, chair umps, and even spectators react to your game.</gameplot>
